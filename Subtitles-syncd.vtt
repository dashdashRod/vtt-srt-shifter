08:30.470 --> 08:33.143
RAJOMON GATE

09:47.790 --> 09:48.825
Who are you?

09:50.990 --> 09:54.460
A wandering spectre
out so late at night?

09:55.350 --> 09:58.183
No, no, I am no such thing

09:59.270 --> 10:03.468
I am returning from Nobleman
Fujiwara's mansion...

10:04.630 --> 10:06.780
...but I am afraid...

10:07.670 --> 10:09.740
...of the bamboo grove ahead

10:13.350 --> 10:18.026
It is dangerous at night with
highwaymen and robbers

10:20.830 --> 10:22.343
Please help me

10:23.790 --> 10:27.908
Will you see me to
the end of the grove?

10:28.270 --> 10:31.262
What if I were a robber?

10:32.070 --> 10:36.029
A fine samurai could
not be a robber

10:36.670 --> 10:40.026
Are you one of
the distinguished Raiko's...

10:40.350 --> 10:43.626
...renowned warriors?

10:44.670 --> 10:47.264
Please help me

10:49.150 --> 10:50.026
Very well

10:50.310 --> 10:55.430
It's out of my way and late already,
but a little delay won't matter

10:56.310 --> 10:57.823
Thank you

11:45.150 --> 11:46.265
Woman

11:47.470 --> 11:49.381
You're very fast

11:50.350 --> 11:52.784
It is a familiar road

11:57.550 --> 11:59.427
A cat?

12:09.390 --> 12:10.869
What is it?

12:11.790 --> 12:15.021
There you are. I wondered
where you'd gone

12:15.430 --> 12:17.705
I heard a cat

12:19.870 --> 12:21.701
Nothing to be afraid of

12:22.110 --> 12:23.907
My heart is pounding

12:24.190 --> 12:25.669
They are starving too

12:26.150 --> 12:29.699
At the Kamo River bed...

12:30.070 --> 12:32.982
...crows peck at the bodies
of those who starved to death

12:46.030 --> 12:47.463
Thank you

12:48.590 --> 12:51.821
It's a secluded place

12:52.230 --> 12:54.266
We have nothing to offer you...

12:54.790 --> 12:58.465
...but I would be happy
if you came inside

13:00.830 --> 13:02.309
Well, let me see...

13:02.830 --> 13:06.345
Mother and I live alone

13:07.070 --> 13:10.426
Shall I accept
your kindness, then?

13:11.310 --> 13:12.379
Please do

13:16.790 --> 13:18.303
This way, please

13:35.550 --> 13:37.268
A fine residence

13:43.030 --> 13:44.986
Much better than my home

13:47.630 --> 13:49.666
Like a nobleman's abode

13:54.070 --> 13:55.583
Is anything wrong?

13:57.870 --> 13:59.747
It seems cold

14:00.750 --> 14:03.947
We only use it...

14:05.110 --> 14:07.465
...when we have guests

14:09.670 --> 14:12.025
I think your being here...

14:12.870 --> 14:15.145
...will soon fill the room
with warmth

14:17.070 --> 14:20.745
Strange things happen
in a war-torn land

14:21.470 --> 14:23.062
Hail fell in Summer

14:23.350 --> 14:27.059
Then it became so hot,
birds fell from the sky

15:00.150 --> 15:01.549
My mother

15:04.790 --> 15:10.262
Thank you for being
so kind to my daughter

15:15.550 --> 15:20.670
Not at all, I enjoyed the night breeze
while I saw her home

15:23.510 --> 15:27.344
I have a feeling we've
met somewhere

15:29.390 --> 15:31.062
You're joking!

15:32.030 --> 15:33.258
Isn't he, Mother?

15:37.150 --> 15:41.063
I believe we have but
I cannot recall where

15:41.350 --> 15:43.227
Serve him sake

16:20.830 --> 16:21.945
A cat?

16:22.390 --> 16:24.506
A homeless stray cat

16:24.790 --> 16:26.940
Please have some more

16:28.150 --> 16:33.099
Excuse me, but
how old are you?

16:35.150 --> 16:36.185
What?

16:36.870 --> 16:39.543
I also have a son

16:40.670 --> 16:44.583
He is about your age

16:47.310 --> 16:48.379
I am twenty-two

16:50.030 --> 16:51.941
My husband is twenty-one

16:55.230 --> 16:58.461
Where is he?
Serving the Emperor?

16:59.550 --> 17:01.222
He went to war

17:01.630 --> 17:02.904
To war?

17:03.430 --> 17:07.867
Yes, three years ago.
He has not returned

17:09.230 --> 17:10.902
Who is his leader?

17:11.470 --> 17:15.383
We do not know

17:16.910 --> 17:19.663
We had planted
spring seeds

17:19.870 --> 17:20.905
Seeds?

17:21.670 --> 17:22.659
Yes

17:23.670 --> 17:28.903
We must plant seeds in an age
of war to keep from starving

17:30.750 --> 17:33.423
Suddenly, soldiers passed by

17:34.430 --> 17:38.025
My son was taken,
plough still in his hands

17:39.790 --> 17:41.382
Do not worry

17:41.710 --> 17:45.020
He'll be a successful samurai
somewhere by now

17:46.550 --> 17:47.983
Somewhere?

17:50.190 --> 17:54.786
Far away to the north in Ezo
or south in Tsukushi

17:56.110 --> 17:58.670
The whole land is up in arms

17:59.030 --> 18:03.785
He must be so great
he has no time to come home

18:04.750 --> 18:08.220
Don't worry. He was
lucky to be taken to war

18:09.190 --> 18:11.499
It's a samurai's world now!

18:13.430 --> 18:15.990
Noblemen cannot fight

18:16.710 --> 18:19.349
So the samurai will
rule the land

18:20.710 --> 18:26.467
The time will come when even
the Mikado must yield to our leader

18:27.710 --> 18:31.225
I used to be a farmer, too

18:32.510 --> 18:36.389
But since the war,
I've risen to this

18:39.550 --> 18:40.949
Do not worry

18:41.390 --> 18:45.269
Wars keep us in food
and everything else

18:45.710 --> 18:48.827
Everything is ours
for the taking

18:53.470 --> 18:54.539
Your mother?

18:56.070 --> 18:58.630
She is being tactful

19:32.750 --> 19:37.187
I am drunk. It is
very good sake

19:37.830 --> 19:41.106
Please make yourself
at home

23:48.070 --> 23:50.106
I am glad you came

23:54.790 --> 23:56.906
It's good sake

23:59.030 --> 24:01.146
Please feel at home

26:49.950 --> 26:51.019
Excuse me

27:53.870 --> 27:56.543
RAJOMON GATE

27:58.710 --> 28:01.099
An official is coming!

28:40.110 --> 28:46.219
You are Raiko Minamoto,
the leader of the samurai

28:47.430 --> 28:51.184
It is not like you at all

28:54.710 --> 29:02.390
Are you doing nothing about the spectre
that appears at Rajomon Gate?

29:04.550 --> 29:11.501
Samurai means men who are
proud of being strong warriors

29:15.110 --> 29:21.822
The spectre may well appear
at any time in the Palace

29:23.470 --> 29:28.021
I cannot sleep
peacefully at night

29:43.310 --> 29:45.028
He told me in
his august voice:

29:46.150 --> 29:49.062
"I cannot sleep
peacefully at night"

29:51.470 --> 29:54.030
Who's running all
over the land fighting?

29:56.110 --> 29:57.748
It's me, Raiko Minamoto!

29:59.310 --> 30:02.029
In the Palace, they kick
balls, play games

30:02.790 --> 30:05.099
They write songs
and love women

30:07.630 --> 30:09.507
Don't say I said this

30:13.070 --> 30:14.742
It's frustrating

30:16.230 --> 30:18.824
The monster's not
a supernatural being

30:19.830 --> 30:22.264
Just an animal or
night-prowler!

30:23.550 --> 30:24.699
Call Kintoki!

30:25.270 --> 30:27.943
He went west
with his troops

30:30.590 --> 30:31.625
Call Tsuna Watanabe!

30:31.990 --> 30:34.379
He took his troops east

30:34.670 --> 30:36.626
Fool! I know that!

30:38.070 --> 30:40.538
I'm just trying to
stiffen your morale!

30:41.830 --> 30:44.105
Is there anyone who will
kill the monster?

30:44.670 --> 30:48.583
EZO, NORTHERN JAPAN

34:01.910 --> 34:04.060
You cut off
Kumasunehiko's head?

34:04.990 --> 34:05.979
Let me see it

34:21.870 --> 34:23.826
Is it really his head?

34:25.030 --> 34:26.941
He told me so himself!

34:27.270 --> 34:30.501
He wore fine armour
and had an iron club

34:31.510 --> 34:36.982
Good! It's really Kumasunehiko's
head. It's a great prize

34:38.670 --> 34:40.626
General Takemaro Fujiwara?

34:41.510 --> 34:42.737
He died in battle!

34:43.190 --> 34:45.181
My army of two
thousand men?

34:45.550 --> 34:47.859
They all died.
The enemy too!

34:49.150 --> 34:50.947
Give me a detailed
account of it!

34:51.630 --> 34:54.940
It was all muddy.
Rushes grew there

34:55.630 --> 34:58.349
The enemy lured us
into the rushes!

34:59.110 --> 35:04.946
The battle began at dawn
and ended at night!

35:06.429 --> 35:10.946
He and I were alone by then

35:11.949 --> 35:16.546
He was hairy all over like
a bear! I was frightened!

35:17.670 --> 35:19.342
Kumasunehiko, I thought!

35:19.950 --> 35:21.349
I was right! He told me so!

35:22.150 --> 35:25.381
He asked my name.
I was going to say "Gintoki"...

35:25.910 --> 35:32.019
Too simple, so I tacked on Yabu
and said I was Yabu-no-Gintoki

35:32.630 --> 35:35.667
He said my name
sounded strong

35:36.150 --> 35:40.621
Asking me if I were a general
he challenged me to a fight

35:41.390 --> 35:46.339
Was he strong! Like Atlas
given an iron club!

35:47.230 --> 35:50.347
I thought his club
would kill me!

35:51.030 --> 35:54.022
I didn't want to die,
so I fought!

35:54.830 --> 35:57.025
I finally cut off his head!

36:02.190 --> 36:05.466
I will call you
Yabu-no-Gintoki

36:06.870 --> 36:11.102
I will add you to my big "Four".
My big "Five" now

37:45.390 --> 37:46.903
Jimbei, it's me!

37:52.350 --> 37:54.022
I'm Hachi, Yone's son

37:55.270 --> 37:56.544
You're...

37:56.950 --> 38:01.148
What happened? My home's burned!
My home's gone!

38:01.430 --> 38:03.705
Yes, you're Hachi all right

38:04.470 --> 38:06.028
Your clothes?

38:06.310 --> 38:07.504
Never mind that!

38:07.990 --> 38:11.903
What about my home?
My mother and wife?

38:13.710 --> 38:19.023
It was last summer.
Kyoto burned for three days and nights

38:19.910 --> 38:23.664
Conquerors and conquered
alike burned things

38:24.350 --> 38:26.466
Fires everywhere in war

38:27.110 --> 38:29.863
Sparks fell even here

38:30.670 --> 38:33.787
We fled into the mountains

38:34.430 --> 38:40.699
When we came back your home
had burned. It was just ashes

38:41.750 --> 38:46.983
Did your mother and wife
burn to death or run away...?

38:47.470 --> 38:50.109
We haven't seen them since

38:51.150 --> 38:53.789
We don't know how
the house burned down

39:21.350 --> 39:26.629
Mother! Oshigi!
Where did you go?

39:39.150 --> 39:40.868
You've won great distinction

39:42.670 --> 39:45.230
Your valour is known
all over the capital

39:46.270 --> 39:50.058
Even beggars say
you're a strong samurai

39:52.070 --> 39:57.428
Yes, young girls especially
make much of him

39:58.390 --> 40:00.460
They hope for
a glimpse of him

40:01.710 --> 40:06.226
The bravest man in the capital
must act accordingly

40:07.910 --> 40:08.979
My orders:

40:09.950 --> 40:15.866
Get rid of the monster that
kills samurai by biting necks

40:17.350 --> 40:20.945
Do not fail since it will
affect my prestige

40:22.190 --> 40:24.465
I offer you my cup

40:25.590 --> 40:26.784
Pour for him

40:42.310 --> 40:44.665
How about women, Gintoki?

40:46.390 --> 40:48.028
Do you think
they're beautiful?

40:50.830 --> 40:52.000
Yes, I do

40:52.150 --> 40:53.219
Very well

40:53.750 --> 40:56.184
When you have killed the monster,
I will give you a woman

40:57.110 --> 41:00.307
Any you want... so don't fail

42:01.350 --> 42:03.068
What is the matter?

42:06.390 --> 42:08.062
Afraid to walk
alone at night?

42:17.350 --> 42:20.820
Are you passing through
the dark grove beyond here?

42:23.830 --> 42:26.219
So am I.
I will see you home

42:28.230 --> 42:29.549
Thank you

43:28.230 --> 43:29.822
Thank you

43:30.230 --> 43:31.822
This is your home?

43:32.590 --> 43:33.705
Yes

43:34.790 --> 43:37.099
I live with my mother

43:37.990 --> 43:41.460
My home's far away yet.
May I rest a bit?

43:48.230 --> 43:50.186
Will you let me rest?

44:09.750 --> 44:11.149
Welcome

44:18.870 --> 44:21.020
It was nice of you to come

44:22.910 --> 44:24.025
Please

45:02.790 --> 45:06.749
Are your names Yone and
Shige, by any chance?

45:12.430 --> 45:14.068
Excuse me if I was being rude

45:15.150 --> 45:20.429
You look exactly like my mother
and wife but are dressed differently

45:21.790 --> 45:24.782
Where are they?

45:26.390 --> 45:30.508
Three years ago, I was taken
east by the army to fight

45:31.750 --> 45:33.786
I was working in the fields

45:35.030 --> 45:36.258
I left my mother and wife

45:41.990 --> 45:47.383
I wanted to return to my mother
and wife, so I fought as hard as I could

45:51.310 --> 45:52.504
I could not die

45:53.670 --> 45:55.786
I made a name for
myself instead

45:56.190 --> 45:59.023
Leader Raiko named me
Yabu-no-Gintoki

46:02.910 --> 46:07.938
But when I went home,
my house was gone

46:09.270 --> 46:10.703
My mother and wife
were gone too

46:17.110 --> 46:18.384
It's very strange

46:20.230 --> 46:23.859
You two look exactly like
my mother and wife

46:25.910 --> 46:30.620
I do not know where they are

46:31.550 --> 46:36.465
But just as you fought day and night
in order to see them...

46:37.630 --> 46:44.263
...your mother and wife must have
waited for you too, day and night

46:48.710 --> 46:53.830
You have returned a fine man

46:56.150 --> 46:58.425
I wonder what has
happened to them

47:00.550 --> 47:04.145
My home was at the edge
of a bamboo grove

47:06.150 --> 47:07.629
About here

47:09.870 --> 47:11.383
How long have you lived here?

47:14.630 --> 47:16.586
For three years

47:16.910 --> 47:18.343
After I left for war?

47:19.710 --> 47:22.543
Yes, I think so.

47:24.270 --> 47:29.219
Is there a reason you are living
in such a lonely place?

47:31.190 --> 47:37.823
A poor mother and daughter,
we live quietly and inconspicuously

47:38.910 --> 47:42.266
If you came three years ago,
did you see my house?

47:48.390 --> 47:50.108
If not, the charred ruins?

48:00.510 --> 48:01.704
Who are you?

48:05.070 --> 48:07.026
Reveal your true selves!

48:29.990 --> 48:31.264
Monsters!

48:31.630 --> 48:34.747
Why have you taken the image
of my mother and wife?

48:41.230 --> 48:44.142
RAJOMON GATE

49:24.590 --> 49:25.625
Woman!

49:29.390 --> 49:30.539
Are you here?

49:53.110 --> 49:55.908
Woman! Come out
if you are here!

49:59.070 --> 50:01.504
Where are you, woman?

50:05.230 --> 50:08.859
I did not come to kill you!
I came to see you!

50:28.030 --> 50:29.099
Woman!

50:32.830 --> 50:33.945
Are you here?

50:39.750 --> 50:40.865
Are you here?

51:13.030 --> 51:16.784
You must want to see him

51:19.590 --> 51:21.740
I want to see my son too

51:55.550 --> 52:00.340
Our vow is to kill samurai
and suck their blood

52:01.950 --> 52:04.748
So we invoked
the evil gods

52:08.230 --> 52:11.302
If only he were
not a samurai...

52:42.750 --> 52:44.263
I beg you...

52:45.910 --> 52:47.389
Bear it

52:49.110 --> 52:50.429
Endure it

52:51.390 --> 52:56.020
Be content to
see him... secretly

53:12.590 --> 53:13.784
It's him!

53:28.550 --> 53:29.585
Are you here?

53:30.910 --> 53:32.025
Are you here?

53:34.310 --> 53:35.425
Where are you?

53:38.910 --> 53:40.389
What has happened to you?

54:02.550 --> 54:03.585
You're here?

54:49.430 --> 54:51.261
It is nice of you to come

54:57.070 --> 54:58.822
We have nothing
to offer you

55:00.390 --> 55:04.781
But permit us to celebrate
your safe return home

55:08.030 --> 55:09.383
Serve him

55:53.590 --> 55:56.980
I will not ask you
who you are

56:00.390 --> 56:03.826
I just wanted to see you,
so I came

56:07.630 --> 56:09.222
You look like my mother

56:10.270 --> 56:11.783
You look like my wife

56:13.150 --> 56:15.983
This is enough for me

56:19.550 --> 56:23.179
I am glad to see you again.
I missed you

56:24.350 --> 56:27.899
We also wished to see you

56:30.590 --> 56:32.660
It will not be dawn
for a long time

56:34.830 --> 56:38.140
Please relax and
be comfortable

57:09.230 --> 57:10.379
I missed you

57:44.630 --> 57:45.949
You have a cat?

57:47.110 --> 57:51.023
No, it is a stray cat
without an owner

57:52.390 --> 57:57.908
That reminds me. When I was taken
to war we had a black kitten at home

58:04.030 --> 58:07.579
Never mind. I will forget
about my home

01:44.270 --> 01:45.339
Excuse me

01:51.470 --> 01:53.506
It will be dawn soon

01:54.470 --> 01:57.348
Please leave before then

02:25.990 --> 02:27.059
I will come again

02:29.430 --> 02:30.658
Will you wait?

03:02.870 --> 03:08.103
Returning empty-handed every
night... seen the monster?

03:08.430 --> 03:12.548
Yes, I saw it but...

03:13.990 --> 03:15.662
Why didn't you kill it?

03:16.550 --> 03:18.381
It's...

03:19.630 --> 03:20.699
You couldn't?

03:22.870 --> 03:23.825
No...

03:26.510 --> 03:28.228
You look bad

03:30.270 --> 03:32.465
You look like
a monster yourself

03:44.910 --> 03:47.026
Have you been bewitched
by the monster?

04:50.950 --> 04:56.388
Your breast, your legs
are like Shige's

04:57.470 --> 04:58.664
You are Shige

04:59.390 --> 05:00.789
You are my wife

05:31.310 --> 05:35.098
Shige, you are
good enough to be eaten

05:35.950 --> 05:39.067
I'll chew you up and
make you part of me!

06:09.470 --> 06:10.539
Hold me tighter!

06:11.190 --> 06:14.739
More! More!

06:59.910 --> 07:00.979
There you are

07:03.470 --> 07:04.664
Where is she?

07:28.230 --> 07:30.425
She is not here anymore

07:30.910 --> 07:32.901
What? Not here?

07:36.310 --> 07:39.620
Why? What happened to her?

07:50.870 --> 07:58.106
She was permitted to see you
and love you for seven days

07:59.910 --> 08:01.343
Please count and see

08:03.190 --> 08:05.226
Last night was the seventh

08:13.310 --> 08:15.505
She shortened her life
to seven days...

08:17.190 --> 08:19.545
...to pledge her love to you

08:24.430 --> 08:27.183
Are you not living
human beings?

08:28.710 --> 08:33.830
So how could she shorten
her life for seven days?

08:36.390 --> 08:37.663
I don't know what you are!

08:38.510 --> 08:44.345
Evil gods or ghosts- supernatural
powers can make you look human?

08:45.910 --> 08:49.538
So you could not die!

08:53.390 --> 08:54.584
She could not die!

09:02.790 --> 09:04.223
I want to see her once more

09:08.109 --> 09:12.228
Bound by a vow, I cannot
tell you who we are

09:15.390 --> 09:18.143
We promised the evil gods

09:25.910 --> 09:29.903
Gods of hate who wander
between this and the netherworld

09:31.470 --> 09:36.749
Promising revenge by sucking blood,
we took human forms

09:40.750 --> 09:43.024
She broke her promise

09:46.750 --> 09:48.024
Our love?

09:49.870 --> 09:50.859
Yes

09:53.430 --> 09:54.703
You are my mother!

10:04.310 --> 10:05.709
She's my wife!

10:11.229 --> 10:14.540
Tell me who killed you!

10:35.310 --> 10:37.141
We promised

10:38.630 --> 10:45.945
So we cannot reveal what we
are or why we became like this

10:46.990 --> 10:48.548
What did you promise?

10:50.910 --> 10:53.105
To suck the blood
of samurai

10:55.990 --> 11:00.666
To suck the blood
of all samurai

11:05.350 --> 11:06.829
You too, are one

11:08.470 --> 11:12.543
Instead of killing you...

11:13.750 --> 11:15.627
...she gave herself to you

11:18.550 --> 11:23.385
So she fell headlong
into hell

11:26.550 --> 11:27.983
She was glad to

11:54.270 --> 11:58.900
Can I not see her anymore?
Is she gone?

12:02.630 --> 12:06.418
Instead of sucking
hateful samurai blood...

12:07.830 --> 12:10.981
...she preferred to love
you and go to hell

12:13.510 --> 12:14.625
Hateful...?

12:18.630 --> 12:19.949
Tell me why!

12:22.710 --> 12:23.904
If only I could...

12:25.590 --> 12:29.378
Bound by a vow,
I cannot tell you

12:31.390 --> 12:32.709
Forgive me

12:37.350 --> 12:38.465
Mother!

12:43.670 --> 12:45.467
What happened to you?

13:09.430 --> 13:11.421
You saw the monster?

13:15.430 --> 13:19.139
If you saw it, I should
think you'd destroy it

13:21.150 --> 13:23.744
I'll take that up later

13:25.830 --> 13:29.425
Tell me what
the monster was like

13:30.070 --> 13:34.029
Vengeful ghosts
murdered by samurai

13:35.070 --> 13:40.098
So they hate samurai
and suck their blood

13:42.830 --> 13:44.468
The ghost told you that?

13:46.430 --> 13:47.419
Fool!

13:50.110 --> 13:53.864
We fight so nobles and the masses
can live without worry!

13:55.430 --> 13:57.739
So how can anyone hate us?

13:58.910 --> 14:02.983
Nobles may benefit from it...

14:03.550 --> 14:07.862
...but the fleeing farmers
starve to death!

14:08.150 --> 14:09.424
They are weak!

14:10.350 --> 14:12.420
The weak always starve!

14:12.950 --> 14:17.262
We risk our lives to
fight. It needs courage!

14:17.830 --> 14:21.061
Isn't that why everyone
respects us?

14:21.390 --> 14:22.425
Take yourself!

14:23.510 --> 14:26.627
A farmer's son once,
but Gintoki now!

14:27.830 --> 14:30.788
Who'd respect or think
a farmer to be a human being?

14:34.990 --> 14:37.743
A samurai, so women
make much of you!

14:39.510 --> 14:42.263
No ghost is going
to hate us!

14:43.110 --> 14:45.226
No ghosts can
make fools of us!

14:49.230 --> 14:51.585
With a samurai's authority
I order you...

14:52.750 --> 14:53.978
...destroy it!

14:56.190 --> 14:59.307
One has been destroyed

14:59.870 --> 15:03.260
What? One has
been detryoyed?

15:05.590 --> 15:06.943
How many were there?

15:09.230 --> 15:10.379
Two

15:12.710 --> 15:14.109
You destroyed one?

15:21.390 --> 15:22.618
The proof?

15:27.590 --> 15:28.625
Well?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.466
It will never appear again

15:33.750 --> 15:35.661
Tell me why

15:37.350 --> 15:38.578
It disappeared!

15:39.390 --> 15:44.748
There was nothing I could do!
It disappeared from my sight!

15:46.750 --> 15:48.024
One more left?

15:48.910 --> 15:49.422
Yes!

15:50.630 --> 15:51.779
Destroy it

15:53.470 --> 15:56.030
- Let someone else...!
- Fool!

15:57.790 --> 15:59.781
If this one gets away...

16:01.710 --> 16:02.825
...I will kill you

16:05.670 --> 16:08.867
It is to uphold
my samurai honour!

17:17.430 --> 17:21.025
RAJOMON GATE

17:38.430 --> 17:40.785
Why did you
not go away?

17:43.990 --> 17:47.585
You sucked blood
every night. Why?

17:51.870 --> 17:53.383
Why can't you
rest in peace?

17:54.550 --> 17:56.268
I wished to see you

17:57.750 --> 18:00.981
I wished to see you
just once more

18:02.910 --> 18:05.982
I have lost my honour
and will be killed!

18:07.350 --> 18:13.141
I have been driven to the point
where I must destroy you or die!

18:14.950 --> 18:21.185
After seeing you, I was
ready to follow her to hell

18:22.350 --> 18:25.581
Satisfied now that
you have seen me?

18:26.910 --> 18:29.947
Please come
to my abode

18:30.990 --> 18:34.460
Will you read the sutra
to me there?

18:35.350 --> 18:37.420
Then I can rest in peace

18:40.510 --> 18:44.389
Please. I have an
edifying sutra

18:45.910 --> 18:50.938
If you read it, my deep-rooted
grudges will fade away

19:24.030 --> 19:27.386
A puddle. Please be careful

19:35.390 --> 19:36.823
What is it?

19:37.950 --> 19:39.224
It's nothing

19:58.230 --> 19:59.345
Something...?

20:39.230 --> 20:40.902
It was a black cat?

20:42.110 --> 20:43.304
I think so

20:49.310 --> 20:51.187
Didn't you just pick it up?

20:51.550 --> 20:54.747
Cat's legs aren't
just lying around!

20:55.830 --> 20:58.549
Don't be angry.
Just a thought

21:00.790 --> 21:03.702
Why would a cat
hate samurai?

21:09.270 --> 21:14.025
They said demons appeared on
Mount Oe so I went for the Mikado

21:15.550 --> 21:17.268
There are no demons

21:18.510 --> 21:20.944
It was Shutendoji,
a bandit

21:22.150 --> 21:26.302
No glory in killing a bandit,
so I said a demon

21:29.430 --> 21:35.141
Now, you've destroyed a cat as big
as a cow and one thousand years old

21:36.990 --> 21:39.709
To purify yourself,
pray for seven days

21:41.910 --> 21:45.266
It's important to make
it the talk of the capital

21:47.710 --> 21:51.544
Do it grandiosely.
Purification. Prayers

22:21.950 --> 22:22.905
Mother

22:28.870 --> 22:30.064
Are you a cat?

22:32.230 --> 22:33.788
Are you my mother?

22:36.710 --> 22:39.543
Return it to me

22:44.910 --> 22:48.459
Return it to me

22:52.510 --> 22:56.298
Return it to me

23:03.910 --> 23:10.304
Mother! Are you a cat
or a ghost?

23:12.710 --> 23:14.701
My mother couldn't be

23:16.070 --> 23:18.903
Mother! Please come out!

23:20.150 --> 23:22.345
If you are my mother,
please come out!

23:23.830 --> 23:26.867
The sword that protects you...

23:27.670 --> 23:31.345
...is in the way

23:33.270 --> 23:37.548
Mother, please rest in peace!

23:40.070 --> 23:46.862
I cut off your arm, thinking an
apparition had taken your form!

23:48.430 --> 23:51.502
Take the sword away

23:52.830 --> 23:57.506
Return my arm to me

23:58.710 --> 24:01.065
What will you do then?

24:02.750 --> 24:06.060
My arm is my weapon

24:07.790 --> 24:15.822
Without it, I cannot suck
the blood of samurai

24:18.310 --> 24:27.503
Will you wander forever
as a vengeful ghost, Mother?

24:29.350 --> 24:33.628
Yes, I will

24:35.110 --> 24:38.580
For the hate I bear
the samurai

24:40.430 --> 24:44.867
For warring samurai

25:24.950 --> 25:25.860
Excuse me...

25:29.790 --> 25:30.700
Excuse me...

25:35.510 --> 25:36.545
Who is it?

25:37.710 --> 25:39.587
Please open the door

25:42.070 --> 25:45.506
Tonight ends the seventh
day of solitary purification

25:46.750 --> 25:48.388
I cannot open
it until dawn

25:49.790 --> 25:52.099
I know that very well

25:53.830 --> 26:00.463
I am a medium in charge of
divination at the Imperial Palace

26:02.510 --> 26:05.388
I cannot break the
rules for anyone

26:07.110 --> 26:11.262
The Mikado is very
troubled about you

26:12.550 --> 26:15.667
Tonight is the last night

26:16.230 --> 26:20.269
So evil spirits may appear
to thwart your plans

26:21.910 --> 26:25.266
The Mikado sent me here...

26:25.910 --> 26:31.940
I am to seal them in so that you
may complete your seven day duty

26:34.590 --> 26:36.182
Inform the Mikado...

26:37.230 --> 26:38.504
...that I am a match for
any evil spirit!

26:38.950 --> 26:40.508
You do not understand at all

26:41.990 --> 26:44.948
Disobey him...

26:46.310 --> 26:50.588
...and not only you
but your leader...

26:51.630 --> 26:57.387
...will be punished too

27:01.550 --> 27:04.383
It will only take a litlle while

27:05.430 --> 27:07.227
Please open the door

27:09.270 --> 27:11.500
Just a little while then

27:49.390 --> 27:53.429
Excuse me for calling
so late at night

27:59.790 --> 28:03.988
Is that the arm you
cut off the ghost?

28:07.150 --> 28:09.823
Please divine or
purify the room

28:10.150 --> 28:13.665
No, no, I cannot
go near it

28:15.150 --> 28:18.779
You offered it to
your god there

28:21.310 --> 28:23.778
I divine by the positive...

28:25.270 --> 28:29.229
...and negative principles

28:31.710 --> 28:36.067
Please show me
the arm more closely

28:37.270 --> 28:43.948
Please be so good as to
bring the arm to me

28:49.630 --> 28:51.029
Very troublesome

29:25.990 --> 29:28.550
May I take it in my hand?

29:31.310 --> 29:32.220
Please do

29:49.830 --> 29:51.104
Your left arm?

29:54.430 --> 29:55.624
I have it back!

30:52.910 --> 30:54.025
Mother!

31:15.390 --> 31:16.345
Spectre!

32:51.630 --> 32:53.427
Mother!

32:59.190 --> 33:01.340
Mother!

34:28.550 --> 34:33.465
THE END

34:34.305 --> 34:40.507
