08:11.470 --> 08:14.143
RAJOMON GATE

09:28.790 --> 09:29.825
Who are you?

09:31.990 --> 09:35.460
A wandering spectre
out so late at night?

09:36.350 --> 09:39.183
No, no, I am no such thing

09:40.270 --> 09:44.468
I am returning from Nobleman
Fujiwara's mansion...

09:45.630 --> 09:47.780
...but I am afraid...

09:48.670 --> 09:50.740
...of the bamboo grove ahead

09:54.350 --> 09:59.026
It is dangerous at night with
highwaymen and robbers

10:01.830 --> 10:03.343
Please help me

10:04.790 --> 10:08.908
Will you see me to
the end of the grove?

10:09.270 --> 10:12.262
What if I were a robber?

10:13.070 --> 10:17.029
A fine samurai could
not be a robber

10:17.670 --> 10:21.026
Are you one of
the distinguished Raiko's...

10:21.350 --> 10:24.626
...renowned warriors?

10:25.670 --> 10:28.264
Please help me

10:30.150 --> 10:31.026
Very well

10:31.310 --> 10:36.430
It's out of my way and late already,
but a little delay won't matter

10:37.310 --> 10:38.823
Thank you

11:26.150 --> 11:27.265
Woman

11:28.470 --> 11:30.381
You're very fast

11:31.350 --> 11:33.784
It is a familiar road

11:38.550 --> 11:40.427
A cat?

11:50.390 --> 11:51.869
What is it?

11:52.790 --> 11:56.021
There you are. I wondered
where you'd gone

11:56.430 --> 11:58.705
I heard a cat

12:00.870 --> 12:02.701
Nothing to be afraid of

12:03.110 --> 12:04.907
My heart is pounding

12:05.190 --> 12:06.669
They are starving too

12:07.150 --> 12:10.699
At the Kamo River bed...

12:11.070 --> 12:13.982
...crows peck at the bodies
of those who starved to death

12:27.030 --> 12:28.463
Thank you

12:29.590 --> 12:32.821
It's a secluded place

12:33.230 --> 12:35.266
We have nothing to offer you...

12:35.790 --> 12:39.465
...but I would be happy
if you came inside

12:41.830 --> 12:43.309
Well, let me see...

12:43.830 --> 12:47.345
Mother and I live alone

12:48.070 --> 12:51.426
Shall I accept
your kindness, then?

12:52.310 --> 12:53.379
Please do

12:57.790 --> 12:59.303
This way, please

13:16.550 --> 13:18.268
A fine residence

13:24.030 --> 13:25.986
Much better than my home

13:28.630 --> 13:30.666
Like a nobleman's abode

13:35.070 --> 13:36.583
Is anything wrong?

13:38.870 --> 13:40.747
It seems cold

13:41.750 --> 13:44.947
We only use it...

13:46.110 --> 13:48.465
...when we have guests

13:50.670 --> 13:53.025
I think your being here...

13:53.870 --> 13:56.145
...will soon fill the room
with warmth

13:58.070 --> 14:01.745
Strange things happen
in a war-torn land

14:02.470 --> 14:04.062
Hail fell in Summer

14:04.350 --> 14:08.059
Then it became so hot,
birds fell from the sky

14:41.150 --> 14:42.549
My mother

14:45.790 --> 14:51.262
Thank you for being
so kind to my daughter

14:56.550 --> 15:01.670
Not at all, I enjoyed the night breeze
while I saw her home

15:04.510 --> 15:08.344
I have a feeling we've
met somewhere

15:10.390 --> 15:12.062
You're joking!

15:13.030 --> 15:14.258
Isn't he, Mother?

15:18.150 --> 15:22.063
I believe we have but
I cannot recall where

15:22.350 --> 15:24.227
Serve him sake

16:01.830 --> 16:02.945
A cat?

16:03.390 --> 16:05.506
A homeless stray cat

16:05.790 --> 16:07.940
Please have some more

16:09.150 --> 16:14.099
Excuse me, but
how old are you?

16:16.150 --> 16:17.185
What?

16:17.870 --> 16:20.543
I also have a son

16:21.670 --> 16:25.583
He is about your age

16:28.310 --> 16:29.379
I am twenty-two

16:31.030 --> 16:32.941
My husband is twenty-one

16:36.230 --> 16:39.461
Where is he?
Serving the Emperor?

16:40.550 --> 16:42.222
He went to war

16:42.630 --> 16:43.904
To war?

16:44.430 --> 16:48.867
Yes, three years ago.
He has not returned

16:50.230 --> 16:51.902
Who is his leader?

16:52.470 --> 16:56.383
We do not know

16:57.910 --> 17:00.663
We had planted
spring seeds

17:00.870 --> 17:01.905
Seeds?

17:02.670 --> 17:03.659
Yes

17:04.670 --> 17:09.903
We must plant seeds in an age
of war to keep from starving

17:11.750 --> 17:14.423
Suddenly, soldiers passed by

17:15.430 --> 17:19.025
My son was taken,
plough still in his hands

17:20.790 --> 17:22.382
Do not worry

17:22.710 --> 17:26.020
He'll be a successful samurai
somewhere by now

17:27.550 --> 17:28.983
Somewhere?

17:31.190 --> 17:35.786
Far away to the north in Ezo
or south in Tsukushi

17:37.110 --> 17:39.670
The whole land is up in arms

17:40.030 --> 17:44.785
He must be so great
he has no time to come home

17:45.750 --> 17:49.220
Don't worry. He was
lucky to be taken to war

17:50.190 --> 17:52.499
It's a samurai's world now!

17:54.430 --> 17:56.990
Noblemen cannot fight

17:57.710 --> 18:00.349
So the samurai will
rule the land

18:01.710 --> 18:07.467
The time will come when even
the Mikado must yield to our leader

18:08.710 --> 18:12.225
I used to be a farmer, too

18:13.510 --> 18:17.389
But since the war,
I've risen to this

18:20.550 --> 18:21.949
Do not worry

18:22.390 --> 18:26.269
Wars keep us in food
and everything else

18:26.710 --> 18:29.827
Everything is ours
for the taking

18:34.470 --> 18:35.539
Your mother?

18:37.070 --> 18:39.630
She is being tactful

19:13.750 --> 19:18.187
I am drunk. It is
very good sake

19:18.830 --> 19:22.106
Please make yourself
at home

23:29.070 --> 23:31.106
I am glad you came

23:35.790 --> 23:37.906
It's good sake

23:40.030 --> 23:42.146
Please feel at home

26:30.950 --> 26:32.019
Excuse me

27:34.870 --> 27:37.543
RAJOMON GATE

27:39.710 --> 27:42.099
An official is coming!

28:21.110 --> 28:27.219
You are Raiko Minamoto,
the leader of the samurai

28:28.430 --> 28:32.184
It is not like you at all

28:35.710 --> 28:43.390
Are you doing nothing about the spectre
that appears at Rajomon Gate?

28:45.550 --> 28:52.501
Samurai means men who are
proud of being strong warriors

28:56.110 --> 29:02.822
The spectre may well appear
at any time in the Palace

29:04.470 --> 29:09.021
I cannot sleep
peacefully at night

29:24.310 --> 29:26.028
He told me in
his august voice:

29:27.150 --> 29:30.062
"I cannot sleep
peacefully at night"

29:32.470 --> 29:35.030
Who's running all
over the land fighting?

29:37.110 --> 29:38.748
It's me, Raiko Minamoto!

29:40.310 --> 29:43.029
In the Palace, they kick
balls, play games

29:43.790 --> 29:46.099
They write songs
and love women

29:48.630 --> 29:50.507
Don't say I said this

29:54.070 --> 29:55.742
It's frustrating

29:57.230 --> 29:59.824
The monster's not
a supernatural being

30:00.830 --> 30:03.264
Just an animal or
night-prowler!

30:04.550 --> 30:05.699
Call Kintoki!

30:06.270 --> 30:08.943
He went west
with his troops

30:11.590 --> 30:12.625
Call Tsuna Watanabe!

30:12.990 --> 30:15.379
He took his troops east

30:15.670 --> 30:17.626
Fool! I know that!

30:19.070 --> 30:21.538
I'm just trying to
stiffen your morale!

30:22.830 --> 30:25.105
Is there anyone who will
kill the monster?

30:25.670 --> 30:29.583
EZO, NORTHERN JAPAN

33:42.910 --> 33:45.060
You cut off
Kumasunehiko's head?

33:45.990 --> 33:46.979
Let me see it

34:02.870 --> 34:04.826
Is it really his head?

34:06.030 --> 34:07.941
He told me so himself!

34:08.270 --> 34:11.501
He wore fine armour
and had an iron club

34:12.510 --> 34:17.982
Good! It's really Kumasunehiko's
head. It's a great prize

34:19.670 --> 34:21.626
General Takemaro Fujiwara?

34:22.510 --> 34:23.737
He died in battle!

34:24.190 --> 34:26.181
My army of two
thousand men?

34:26.550 --> 34:28.859
They all died.
The enemy too!

34:30.150 --> 34:31.947
Give me a detailed
account of it!

34:32.630 --> 34:35.940
It was all muddy.
Rushes grew there

34:36.630 --> 34:39.349
The enemy lured us
into the rushes!

34:40.110 --> 34:45.946
The battle began at dawn
and ended at night!

34:47.429 --> 34:51.946
He and I were alone by then

34:52.949 --> 34:57.546
He was hairy all over like
a bear! I was frightened!

34:58.670 --> 35:00.342
Kumasunehiko, I thought!

35:00.950 --> 35:02.349
I was right! He told me so!

35:03.150 --> 35:06.381
He asked my name.
I was going to say "Gintoki"...

35:06.910 --> 35:13.019
Too simple, so I tacked on Yabu
and said I was Yabu-no-Gintoki

35:13.630 --> 35:16.667
He said my name
sounded strong

35:17.150 --> 35:21.621
Asking me if I were a general
he challenged me to a fight

35:22.390 --> 35:27.339
Was he strong! Like Atlas
given an iron club!

35:28.230 --> 35:31.347
I thought his club
would kill me!

35:32.030 --> 35:35.022
I didn't want to die,
so I fought!

35:35.830 --> 35:38.025
I finally cut off his head!

35:43.190 --> 35:46.466
I will call you
Yabu-no-Gintoki

35:47.870 --> 35:52.102
I will add you to my big "Four".
My big "Five" now

37:26.390 --> 37:27.903
Jimbei, it's me!

37:33.350 --> 37:35.022
I'm Hachi, Yone's son

37:36.270 --> 37:37.544
You're...

37:37.950 --> 37:42.148
What happened? My home's burned!
My home's gone!

37:42.430 --> 37:44.705
Yes, you're Hachi all right

37:45.470 --> 37:47.028
Your clothes?

37:47.310 --> 37:48.504
Never mind that!

37:48.990 --> 37:52.903
What about my home?
My mother and wife?

37:54.710 --> 38:00.023
It was last summer.
Kyoto burned for three days and nights

38:00.910 --> 38:04.664
Conquerors and conquered
alike burned things

38:05.350 --> 38:07.466
Fires everywhere in war

38:08.110 --> 38:10.863
Sparks fell even here

38:11.670 --> 38:14.787
We fled into the mountains

38:15.430 --> 38:21.699
When we came back your home
had burned. It was just ashes

38:22.750 --> 38:27.983
Did your mother and wife
burn to death or run away...?

38:28.470 --> 38:31.109
We haven't seen them since

38:32.150 --> 38:34.789
We don't know how
the house burned down

39:02.350 --> 39:07.629
Mother! Oshigi!
Where did you go?

39:20.150 --> 39:21.868
You've won great distinction

39:23.670 --> 39:26.230
Your valour is known
all over the capital

39:27.270 --> 39:31.058
Even beggars say
you're a strong samurai

39:33.070 --> 39:38.428
Yes, young girls especially
make much of him

39:39.390 --> 39:41.460
They hope for
a glimpse of him

39:42.710 --> 39:47.226
The bravest man in the capital
must act accordingly

39:48.910 --> 39:49.979
My orders:

39:50.950 --> 39:56.866
Get rid of the monster that
kills samurai by biting necks

39:58.350 --> 40:01.945
Do not fail since it will
affect my prestige

40:03.190 --> 40:05.465
I offer you my cup

40:06.590 --> 40:07.784
Pour for him

40:23.310 --> 40:25.665
How about women, Gintoki?

40:27.390 --> 40:29.028
Do you think
they're beautiful?

40:31.830 --> 40:33.000
Yes, I do

40:33.150 --> 40:34.219
Very well

40:34.750 --> 40:37.184
When you have killed the monster,
I will give you a woman

40:38.110 --> 40:41.307
Any you want... so don't fail

41:42.350 --> 41:44.068
What is the matter?

41:47.390 --> 41:49.062
Afraid to walk
alone at night?

41:58.350 --> 42:01.820
Are you passing through
the dark grove beyond here?

42:04.830 --> 42:07.219
So am I.
I will see you home

42:09.230 --> 42:10.549
Thank you

43:09.230 --> 43:10.822
Thank you

43:11.230 --> 43:12.822
This is your home?

43:13.590 --> 43:14.705
Yes

43:15.790 --> 43:18.099
I live with my mother

43:18.990 --> 43:22.460
My home's far away yet.
May I rest a bit?

43:29.230 --> 43:31.186
Will you let me rest?

43:50.750 --> 43:52.149
Welcome

43:59.870 --> 44:02.020
It was nice of you to come

44:03.910 --> 44:05.025
Please

44:43.790 --> 44:47.749
Are your names Yone and
Shige, by any chance?

44:53.430 --> 44:55.068
Excuse me if I was being rude

44:56.150 --> 45:01.429
You look exactly like my mother
and wife but are dressed differently

45:02.790 --> 45:05.782
Where are they?

45:07.390 --> 45:11.508
Three years ago, I was taken
east by the army to fight

45:12.750 --> 45:14.786
I was working in the fields

45:16.030 --> 45:17.258
I left my mother and wife

45:22.990 --> 45:28.383
I wanted to return to my mother
and wife, so I fought as hard as I could

45:32.310 --> 45:33.504
I could not die

45:34.670 --> 45:36.786
I made a name for
myself instead

45:37.190 --> 45:40.023
Leader Raiko named me
Yabu-no-Gintoki

45:43.910 --> 45:48.938
But when I went home,
my house was gone

45:50.270 --> 45:51.703
My mother and wife
were gone too

45:58.110 --> 45:59.384
It's very strange

46:01.230 --> 46:04.859
You two look exactly like
my mother and wife

46:06.910 --> 46:11.620
I do not know where they are

46:12.550 --> 46:17.465
But just as you fought day and night
in order to see them...

46:18.630 --> 46:25.263
...your mother and wife must have
waited for you too, day and night

46:29.710 --> 46:34.830
You have returned a fine man

46:37.150 --> 46:39.425
I wonder what has
happened to them

46:41.550 --> 46:45.145
My home was at the edge
of a bamboo grove

46:47.150 --> 46:48.629
About here

46:50.870 --> 46:52.383
How long have you lived here?

46:55.630 --> 46:57.586
For three years

46:57.910 --> 46:59.343
After I left for war?

47:00.710 --> 47:03.543
Yes, I think so.

47:05.270 --> 47:10.219
Is there a reason you are living
in such a lonely place?

47:12.190 --> 47:18.823
A poor mother and daughter,
we live quietly and inconspicuously

47:19.910 --> 47:23.266
If you came three years ago,
did you see my house?

47:29.390 --> 47:31.108
If not, the charred ruins?

47:41.510 --> 47:42.704
Who are you?

47:46.070 --> 47:48.026
Reveal your true selves!

48:10.990 --> 48:12.264
Monsters!

48:12.630 --> 48:15.747
Why have you taken the image
of my mother and wife?

48:22.230 --> 48:25.142
RAJOMON GATE

49:05.590 --> 49:06.625
Woman!

49:10.390 --> 49:11.539
Are you here?

49:34.110 --> 49:36.908
Woman! Come out
if you are here!

49:40.070 --> 49:42.504
Where are you, woman?

49:46.230 --> 49:49.859
I did not come to kill you!
I came to see you!

50:09.030 --> 50:10.099
Woman!

50:13.830 --> 50:14.945
Are you here?

50:20.750 --> 50:21.865
Are you here?

50:54.030 --> 50:57.784
You must want to see him

51:00.590 --> 51:02.740
I want to see my son too

51:36.550 --> 51:41.340
Our vow is to kill samurai
and suck their blood

51:42.950 --> 51:45.748
So we invoked
the evil gods

51:49.230 --> 51:52.302
If only he were
not a samurai...

52:23.750 --> 52:25.263
I beg you...

52:26.910 --> 52:28.389
Bear it

52:30.110 --> 52:31.429
Endure it

52:32.390 --> 52:37.020
Be content to
see him... secretly

52:53.590 --> 52:54.784
It's him!

53:09.550 --> 53:10.585
Are you here?

53:11.910 --> 53:13.025
Are you here?

53:15.310 --> 53:16.425
Where are you?

53:19.910 --> 53:21.389
What has happened to you?

53:43.550 --> 53:44.585
You're here?

54:30.430 --> 54:32.261
It is nice of you to come

54:38.070 --> 54:39.822
We have nothing
to offer you

54:41.390 --> 54:45.781
But permit us to celebrate
your safe return home

54:49.030 --> 54:50.383
Serve him

55:34.590 --> 55:37.980
I will not ask you
who you are

55:41.390 --> 55:44.826
I just wanted to see you,
so I came

55:48.630 --> 55:50.222
You look like my mother

55:51.270 --> 55:52.783
You look like my wife

55:54.150 --> 55:56.983
This is enough for me

56:00.550 --> 56:04.179
I am glad to see you again.
I missed you

56:05.350 --> 56:08.899
We also wished to see you

56:11.590 --> 56:13.660
It will not be dawn
for a long time

56:15.830 --> 56:19.140
Please relax and
be comfortable

56:50.230 --> 56:51.379
I missed you

57:25.630 --> 57:26.949
You have a cat?

57:28.110 --> 57:32.023
No, it is a stray cat
without an owner

57:33.390 --> 57:38.908
That reminds me. When I was taken
to war we had a black kitten at home

57:45.030 --> 57:48.579
Never mind. I will forget
about my home

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:26.339
Excuse me

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:34.506
It will be dawn soon

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:38.348
Please leave before then

01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:08.059
I will come again

01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:11.658
Will you wait?

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:49.103
Returning empty-handed every
night... seen the monster?

01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:53.548
Yes, I saw it but...

01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:56.662
Why didn't you kill it?

01:02:57.550 --> 01:02:59.381
It's...

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:01.699
You couldn't?

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:04.825
No...

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:09.228
You look bad

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:13.465
You look like
a monster yourself

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:28.026
Have you been bewitched
by the monster?

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:37.388
Your breast, your legs
are like Shige's

01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:39.664
You are Shige

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:41.789
You are my wife

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:16.098
Shige, you are
good enough to be eaten

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:20.067
I'll chew you up and
make you part of me!

01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:51.539
Hold me tighter!

01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:55.739
More! More!

01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:41.979
There you are

01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:45.664
Where is she?

01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:11.425
She is not here anymore

01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:13.901
What? Not here?

01:07:17.310 --> 01:07:20.620
Why? What happened to her?

01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:39.106
She was permitted to see you
and love you for seven days

01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:42.343
Please count and see

01:07:44.190 --> 01:07:46.226
Last night was the seventh

01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:56.505
She shortened her life
to seven days...

01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:00.545
...to pledge her love to you

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:08.183
Are you not living
human beings?

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:14.830
So how could she shorten
her life for seven days?

01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:18.663
I don't know what you are!

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:25.345
Evil gods or ghosts- supernatural
powers can make you look human?

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:30.538
So you could not die!

01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:35.584
She could not die!

01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:45.223
I want to see her once more

01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:53.228
Bound by a vow, I cannot
tell you who we are

01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:59.143
We promised the evil gods

01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:10.903
Gods of hate who wander
between this and the netherworld

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:17.749
Promising revenge by sucking blood,
we took human forms

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:24.024
She broke her promise

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:29.024
Our love?

01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:31.859
Yes

01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:35.703
You are my mother!

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:46.709
She's my wife!

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:55.540
Tell me who killed you!

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:18.141
We promised

01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:26.945
So we cannot reveal what we
are or why we became like this

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.548
What did you promise?

01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:34.105
To suck the blood
of samurai

01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:41.666
To suck the blood
of all samurai

01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:47.829
You too, are one

01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:53.543
Instead of killing you...

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.627
...she gave herself to you

01:10:59.550 --> 01:11:04.385
So she fell headlong
into hell

01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:08.983
She was glad to

01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:39.900
Can I not see her anymore?
Is she gone?

01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:47.418
Instead of sucking
hateful samurai blood...

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:51.981
...she preferred to love
you and go to hell

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:55.625
Hateful...?

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:00.949
Tell me why!

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:04.904
If only I could...

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:10.378
Bound by a vow,
I cannot tell you

01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:13.709
Forgive me

01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:19.465
Mother!

01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:26.467
What happened to you?

01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:52.421
You saw the monster?

01:12:56.430 --> 01:13:00.139
If you saw it, I should
think you'd destroy it

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:04.744
I'll take that up later

01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:10.425
Tell me what
the monster was like

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:15.029
Vengeful ghosts
murdered by samurai

01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:21.098
So they hate samurai
and suck their blood

01:13:23.830 --> 01:13:25.468
The ghost told you that?

01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:28.419
Fool!

01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:34.864
We fight so nobles and the masses
can live without worry!

01:13:36.430 --> 01:13:38.739
So how can anyone hate us?

01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:43.983
Nobles may benefit from it...

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:48.862
...but the fleeing farmers
starve to death!

01:13:49.150 --> 01:13:50.424
They are weak!

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:53.420
The weak always starve!

01:13:53.950 --> 01:13:58.262
We risk our lives to
fight. It needs courage!

01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:02.061
Isn't that why everyone
respects us?

01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:03.425
Take yourself!

01:14:04.510 --> 01:14:07.627
A farmer's son once,
but Gintoki now!

01:14:08.830 --> 01:14:11.788
Who'd respect or think
a farmer to be a human being?

01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:18.743
A samurai, so women
make much of you!

01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:23.263
No ghost is going
to hate us!

01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:26.226
No ghosts can
make fools of us!

01:14:30.230 --> 01:14:32.585
With a samurai's authority
I order you...

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:34.978
...destroy it!

01:14:37.190 --> 01:14:40.307
One has been destroyed

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:44.260
What? One has
been detryoyed?

01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:47.943
How many were there?

01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:51.379
Two

01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:55.109
You destroyed one?

01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:03.618
The proof?

01:15:08.590 --> 01:15:09.625
Well?

01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:13.466
It will never appear again

01:15:14.750 --> 01:15:16.661
Tell me why

01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:19.578
It disappeared!

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:25.748
There was nothing I could do!
It disappeared from my sight!

01:15:27.750 --> 01:15:29.024
One more left?

01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:30.422
Yes!

01:15:31.630 --> 01:15:32.779
Destroy it

01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:37.030
- Let someone else...!
- Fool!

01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:40.781
If this one gets away...

01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:43.825
...I will kill you

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:49.867
It is to uphold
my samurai honour!

01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:02.025
RAJOMON GATE

01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:21.785
Why did you
not go away?

01:17:24.990 --> 01:17:28.585
You sucked blood
every night. Why?

01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:34.383
Why can't you
rest in peace?

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:37.268
I wished to see you

01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:41.981
I wished to see you
just once more

01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:46.982
I have lost my honour
and will be killed!

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:54.141
I have been driven to the point
where I must destroy you or die!

01:17:55.950 --> 01:18:02.185
After seeing you, I was
ready to follow her to hell

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:06.581
Satisfied now that
you have seen me?

01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:10.947
Please come
to my abode

01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:15.460
Will you read the sutra
to me there?

01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:18.420
Then I can rest in peace

01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:25.389
Please. I have an
edifying sutra

01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:31.938
If you read it, my deep-rooted
grudges will fade away

01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:08.386
A puddle. Please be careful

01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:17.823
What is it?

01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:20.224
It's nothing

01:19:39.230 --> 01:19:40.345
Something...?

01:20:20.230 --> 01:20:21.902
It was a black cat?

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:24.304
I think so

01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:32.187
Didn't you just pick it up?

01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:35.747
Cat's legs aren't
just lying around!

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:39.549
Don't be angry.
Just a thought

01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:44.702
Why would a cat
hate samurai?

01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:55.025
They said demons appeared on
Mount Oe so I went for the Mikado

01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:58.268
There are no demons

01:20:59.510 --> 01:21:01.944
It was Shutendoji,
a bandit

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:07.302
No glory in killing a bandit,
so I said a demon

01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:16.141
Now, you've destroyed a cat as big
as a cow and one thousand years old

01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:20.709
To purify yourself,
pray for seven days

01:21:22.910 --> 01:21:26.266
It's important to make
it the talk of the capital

01:21:28.710 --> 01:21:32.544
Do it grandiosely.
Purification. Prayers

01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:03.905
Mother

01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:11.064
Are you a cat?

01:22:13.230 --> 01:22:14.788
Are you my mother?

01:22:17.710 --> 01:22:20.543
Return it to me

01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:29.459
Return it to me

01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:37.298
Return it to me

01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:51.304
Mother! Are you a cat
or a ghost?

01:22:53.710 --> 01:22:55.701
My mother couldn't be

01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:59.903
Mother! Please come out!

01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:03.345
If you are my mother,
please come out!

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:07.867
The sword that protects you...

01:23:08.670 --> 01:23:12.345
...is in the way

01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:18.548
Mother, please rest in peace!

01:23:21.070 --> 01:23:27.862
I cut off your arm, thinking an
apparition had taken your form!

01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:32.502
Take the sword away

01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:38.506
Return my arm to me

01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:42.065
What will you do then?

01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:47.060
My arm is my weapon

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:56.822
Without it, I cannot suck
the blood of samurai

01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:08.503
Will you wander forever
as a vengeful ghost, Mother?

01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:14.628
Yes, I will

01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:19.580
For the hate I bear
the samurai

01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:25.867
For warring samurai

01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:06.860
Excuse me...

01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:11.700
Excuse me...

01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:17.545
Who is it?

01:25:18.710 --> 01:25:20.587
Please open the door

01:25:23.070 --> 01:25:26.506
Tonight ends the seventh
day of solitary purification

01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:29.388
I cannot open
it until dawn

01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:33.099
I know that very well

01:25:34.830 --> 01:25:41.463
I am a medium in charge of
divination at the Imperial Palace

01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:46.388
I cannot break the
rules for anyone

01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:52.262
The Mikado is very
troubled about you

01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:56.667
Tonight is the last night

01:25:57.230 --> 01:26:01.269
So evil spirits may appear
to thwart your plans

01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:06.266
The Mikado sent me here...

01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:12.940
I am to seal them in so that you
may complete your seven day duty

01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:17.182
Inform the Mikado...

01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:19.504
...that I am a match for
any evil spirit!

01:26:19.950 --> 01:26:21.508
You do not understand at all

01:26:22.990 --> 01:26:25.948
Disobey him...

01:26:27.310 --> 01:26:31.588
...and not only you
but your leader...

01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:38.387
...will be punished too

01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:45.383
It will only take a litlle while

01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:48.227
Please open the door

01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:52.500
Just a little while then

01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:34.429
Excuse me for calling
so late at night

01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:44.988
Is that the arm you
cut off the ghost?

01:27:48.150 --> 01:27:50.823
Please divine or
purify the room

01:27:51.150 --> 01:27:54.665
No, no, I cannot
go near it

01:27:56.150 --> 01:27:59.779
You offered it to
your god there

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:04.778
I divine by the positive...

01:28:06.270 --> 01:28:10.229
...and negative principles

01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:17.067
Please show me
the arm more closely

01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:24.948
Please be so good as to
bring the arm to me

01:28:30.630 --> 01:28:32.029
Very troublesome

01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:09.550
May I take it in my hand?

01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:13.220
Please do

01:29:30.830 --> 01:29:32.104
Your left arm?

01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:36.624
I have it back!

01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:35.025
Mother!

01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:57.345
Spectre!

01:32:32.630 --> 01:32:34.427
Mother!

01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:42.340
Mother!

01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:14.465
THE END
