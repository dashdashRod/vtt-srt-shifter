21

Father, telephone.

22
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,551
Just a minute.
Who is it?

23
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:36,279
- The court.
- Oh, I forgot!

24
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,923
The court? Why?

25
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:44,757
The dental association nominated him
to be a family court arbitrator.

26
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,366
Divorce suits, estate battles -
things like that.

27
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,763
That's tough work.

28
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,735
Actually, he really likes it,

29
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:58,104
though he grumbles a lot.

30
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:08,845
I have to be in court at 1:00.
Another afternoon lost.

JUDGE ARAKI

34
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,471
Please stay out here.

35
00:03:33,677 --> 00:03:36,646
He's provided
for my daughter a long time -

36
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:38,473
Yes, but in this case -

37
00:03:38,682 --> 00:03:44,052
We're not asking for ourselves,
but there's the baby to consider.

38
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:45,982
Please just wait here.

39
00:03:46,189 --> 00:03:49,920
Why can't I go in?
I'm just as much his son as you.

40
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:51,820
Enough out of you!

41
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:56,327
How dare you talk
to us like that!

42
00:03:56,798 --> 00:04:00,131
You're just his son-in-law.

43
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:02,633
She may be illegitimate,

44
00:04:02,837 --> 00:04:05,032
but she's his flesh and blood.

45
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:06,263
Listen,

46
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:10,466
I don't see how this case
concerns any of you.

47
00:04:10,678 --> 00:04:13,909
- Hold on!
- We have a lot at stake!

48
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:17,345
Listen, I think we all need
to discuss it,

49
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:22,717
but Father's very upset.
We need to calm him down first.

50
00:04:22,923 --> 00:04:28,691
Once that's done,
everyone can have their say.

51
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:30,988
Please just wait here.

52
00:04:39,305 --> 00:04:42,297
- You heard me!
- But I -

53
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:49,647
I don't know how you know Father,
but you'll have your say as well.

54
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:51,713
He's in quite a state!

55
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,645
Listen to me:

56
00:04:53,853 --> 00:04:56,913
I'm a court mediator.

57
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:02,317
I'm terribly sorry.

58
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:04,995
Please, after you.

59
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,529
<i>- Damn fools!
- Father!</i>

60
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,391
<i>I just don't -</i>

61
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,229
Welcome.

62
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,874
I just don't get it.

63
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:23,472
This is a family matter!
Just butt out!

64
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:28,139
I'm so sorry.
Father's always like this.

65
00:05:29,152 --> 00:05:32,519
Ichiro, say something.
This is too much.

66
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:37,721
Father, you see -

67
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:38,916
Fool!

68
00:05:39,128 --> 00:05:40,789
We discussed it,

69
00:05:40,996 --> 00:05:44,329
and we asked them to -

70
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:48,526
That's right.
We received a formal petition.

71
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:51,603
Whatever it says,
I won't recognize it!

72
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:54,173
Legally, the petition -

73
00:05:55,109 --> 00:06:01,014
Father, not recognizing it
is like not recognizing us as adults.

74
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,408
Tell me,

75
00:06:04,618 --> 00:06:07,314
does this bunch
look like adults to you?

76
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,978
These loafers think
about nothing but my estate!

77
00:06:11,191 --> 00:06:13,659
Jackasses!
- Father!

78
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:18,024
We understand your feelings, Father.
Don't we, dear?

79
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:22,894
That's right. All Japanese
people share your anxiety.

80
00:06:23,103 --> 00:06:27,836
It's just that you're a bit -
Right, Ichiro?

81
00:06:28,074 --> 00:06:31,168
Just say it! I'm insane!

82
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:34,171
Why don't you listen?

83
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,477
Father!

84
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:41,578
Mother, please!

85
00:06:41,787 --> 00:06:43,550
Don't make a scene.

86
00:06:43,754 --> 00:06:46,450
Let's all just go home and -

87
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:50,458
We're here because
we can't resolve this ourselves.

88
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:55,628
We're just making
a spectacle of ourselves.

89
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,964
Ichiro...

90
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:58,657
do something!

91
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,130
This is terrible!
You're the eldest!

92
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:06,036
That's right.
You're embarrassing us all.

93
00:07:08,778 --> 00:07:12,680
I'm sorry for the trouble
we've caused.

94
00:07:12,883 --> 00:07:16,683
It's all right.
This is our job.

95
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:22,790
Family court exists

96
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:26,985
precisely so you have a place
to bring your troubles.

97
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:33,692
We're happy to mediate
in even the ugliest spousal disputes.

98
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:41,231
And other disputes too:

99
00:07:41,441 --> 00:07:44,808
Between parents,
children, and siblings.

100
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:50,952
Life's full of disputes, and bashing
each other's heads solves nothing.

101
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:57,681
So there's no choice
but to enlist the aid of a third party.

102
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:05,791
People need to speak openly
so that resentment doesn't build.

103
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:11,196
Our job is to listen
to those pent-up frustrations.

104
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:16,034
We listen to both sides
and help you think through a solution.

105
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,178
So what do you say?

106
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:29,349
Why not let everyone
have their say and let us help?

107
00:08:36,527 --> 00:08:38,927
Miss Tamiya,
let's get started.

108
00:08:39,798 --> 00:08:43,029
Everyone please wait
in the hallway.

109
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,266
Father.

110
00:08:58,214 --> 00:09:00,648
Not consulting with me first!

111
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:02,744
Fools!

112
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:13,658
We've got our work
cut out for us this time.

113
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:15,089
Thank you for coming.

114
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:17,993
Allow me to introduce
Mr. Hori of the bar association.

115
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,065
This is Dr. Harada.

116
00:09:20,302 --> 00:09:22,167
- Pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.

117
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,100
We should examine the petition.

118
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:29,174
There's not much time,
so I'll read it aloud.

119
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:38,551
I'll skip the names
and addresses of the parties.

120
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:41,381
The aim of the petition
is as follows:

121
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:45,251
"I hereby request
that Kiichi Nakajima -"

122
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,153
The older gentleman.

123
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,127
"Be pronounced
mentally incompetent

124
00:09:52,998 --> 00:09:57,059
on the grounds
that the petitioner,

125
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:01,433
wife of aforementioned
Kiichi Nakajima,

126
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,201
in June of last year
discovered that her husband

127
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:12,249
harbored delusional fears
about atomic and hydrogen bombs

128
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,715
and subsequent radioactivity...

129
00:10:17,755 --> 00:10:24,888
...atomic and hydrogen bombs
and subsequent radioactivity.

130
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:31,034
In September, seeking to avoid
fallout from the south,

131
00:10:31,335 --> 00:10:35,203
and despite
his entire family's opposition,

132
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:42,106
<i>he purchased 1.6 square kilometers
of property in Akita Prefecture</i>

133
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:46,611
<i>and began to construct thereupon
an unusual underground dwelling.</i>

134
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:51,844
<i>In November,
after reading in a newspaper</i>

135
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:57,185
<i>that fallout
would come from the north,</i>

136
00:10:57,393 --> 00:11:00,590
<i>he halted construction.</i>

137
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:04,959
<i>As a result,
the family suffered</i>

138
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,464
<i>the senseless loss</i>

139
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:10,600
<i>of 7.4 million yen.</i>

140
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:18,072
<i>Mr. Nakajima's erratic behavior
did not end there.</i>

141
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:23,873
<i>He now claims
that the only safe place on earth</i>

142
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:27,383
<i>is South America.</i>

143
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:34,618
<i>He has unilaterally set in motion a plan
to move all his dependents to Brazil</i>

144
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:41,130
<i>and has announced that
he will invest all his resources</i>

145
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,097
to this end.

146
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,364
Unless he is declared
mentally incompetent

147
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:51,065
and subject to conservatorship,

148
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:56,714
his life and that
of all members of his family

149
00:11:56,915 --> 00:12:00,373
will in all likelihood
be brought to ruin.

150
00:12:00,585 --> 00:12:07,616
I therefore submit this petition
in request of said intervention. "

151
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:26,069
Listen, what will we do
if he's declared incompetent?

152
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:29,006
It could be real trouble.

153
00:12:29,712 --> 00:12:34,706
He won't be able
to use his money as he wishes.

154
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:39,150
His wife will be appointed
legal conservator.

155
00:12:39,988 --> 00:12:42,684
If that happens,
my daughter -

156
00:12:44,226 --> 00:12:48,720
Don't worry about Asako.
Young people today are very resourceful.

157
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:52,025
Will the applicant
please step inside?

158
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,407
Mother.

159
00:12:59,874 --> 00:13:01,068
Mother, come on.

160
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:04,711
Please spare me this.
You all go in.

161
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:06,903
Not this again!

162
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:10,742
You're the petitioner!
You have to go!

163
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:12,351
I just want -

164
00:13:12,552 --> 00:13:15,680
Hurry up
and stop wasting time!

165
00:13:19,726 --> 00:13:22,286
Mrs. Toyo Nakajima?
Please come in.

166
00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:25,157
I'm Ichiro, the eldest son.

167
00:13:25,564 --> 00:13:27,657
Jiro, second son.

168
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:30,201
I'm Yoshi, eldest daughter.

169
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:32,336
I'm Yoshi's husband.

170
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:34,904
I'm sorry, but only
those listed on the petition -

171
00:13:35,107 --> 00:13:38,941
Well, I guess
I don't need to be there.

172
00:14:34,062 --> 00:14:35,927
Hey, Susumu.

173
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:46,469
What do you think
about the A-bomb and the H-bomb?

174
00:14:47,107 --> 00:14:48,506
What's this about?

175
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,233
Never mind that.

176
00:14:50,445 --> 00:14:53,778
What do you think?
Are you afraid?

177
00:14:53,981 --> 00:14:56,040
Of course I am.

178
00:14:57,251 --> 00:14:59,276
You're really afraid?

179
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,514
Yes, really.
Everyone's afraid of them.

180
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:08,289
Then how can you be so calm?

181
00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:11,194
Well, because...

182
00:15:12,665 --> 00:15:15,634
there's nothing we can do,
is there?

183
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:19,498
<i>Sumiko, let's eat.
- Right away.</i>

184
00:15:23,442 --> 00:15:25,307
Sorry to keep you waiting.

185
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:44,453
But what if someone

186
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:48,792
was consumed with worry?

187
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,960
He'd have a nervous breakdown.
No doubt about it.

188
00:15:54,337 --> 00:15:56,635
You're wrong.

189
00:15:58,274 --> 00:16:02,005
This wasn't a nervous breakdown
by any means.

190
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,911
What is this all about?

191
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:08,275
Today's case?

192
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,280
What happened?

193
00:16:17,593 --> 00:16:20,994
I just can't figure him out.

194
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:31,301
NAKAJIMA FOUNDRY

195
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,238
Stop!

196
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:44,116
Okay!

197
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:50,955
Stop!

198
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,835
Here you are.

199
00:17:47,076 --> 00:17:49,237
Seven tons, 320 kilograms.

200
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,276
That's okay, ma'am.

201
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:00,513
Koto Gas No. 2?

202
00:18:00,722 --> 00:18:03,885
It's not as good as our A1.

203
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:08,223
<i>I'd say it's 10% -
no, 12% ash.</i>

204
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,690
Mr. Ishida would like immediate
payment, even if in promissory notes.

205
00:18:14,902 --> 00:18:17,564
- Price?
- 17,500 a ton.

206
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:21,732
Freight costs went up recently.

207
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:26,140
<i>- Ash content is 9%?
- Per Tokyo Gas.</i>

208
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:29,874
<i>- I say it's 13%.
- Impossible!</i>

209
00:18:30,084 --> 00:18:33,247
Take off 1,500 yen per ton

210
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:35,546
and we'll pay tomorrow in cash.

211
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,591
You drive a hard bargain.

212
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:44,253
Ichiro, watch that furnace!
I've told you a million times!

213
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:47,866
1,500 less per ton will kill me.

214
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:51,002
Don't let him
smooth-talk you, Ichiro!

215
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:53,637
Sue, what are you saying?

216
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,365
Ichiro's such a pushover.

217
00:18:56,575 --> 00:18:59,738
He's the one who needs
a conservator, not Father.

218
00:18:59,944 --> 00:19:02,208
Watch your mouth,
little girl.

219
00:19:02,414 --> 00:19:04,439
And you're the grown-up,
I suppose?

220
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:08,779
Four grown-ups spent
an entire day in court, and for what?

221
00:19:08,986 --> 00:19:09,953
What?

222
00:19:10,154 --> 00:19:13,521
"Calm down and come back later. "
Right?

223
00:19:13,758 --> 00:19:15,919
- Watch your mouth!
- No, don't!

224
00:19:16,127 --> 00:19:20,996
You still feel like quarrelling
after all that's happened?

225
00:19:44,854 --> 00:19:46,253
Who's that man?

226
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:49,720
- Mr. Okamoto.
- No, the other man.

227
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:53,826
Ichiro, you know that other man?

228
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:20,810
Mrs. Nakajima...

229
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,179
I'm impressed!

230
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,550
Few people your age
have that kind of resolve.

231
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:29,421
Frankly, I was shocked
to hear of your husband's plan.

232
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:34,492
I tried to stop him,
but he's not easily dissuaded.

233
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,263
But the more I thought,
the more I admired his decision.

234
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:43,442
Everyone has their own
feelings on the matter:

235
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,806
Some want to flee Japan,
others want to come back.

236
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:53,041
I brought an old friend.
He has a big farm overseas.

237
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:55,378
This way, please.

238
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:53,569
Out of the way!

239
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:58,140
What a great idea, huh?

240
00:21:58,346 --> 00:22:00,712
Almost as good as being there.

241
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:06,748
I've seen the movie.
Looks like a really nice place to live.

242
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:37,207
Look closely.
That will be your house.

243
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:39,610
I see.

244
00:22:40,418 --> 00:22:42,352
What a nice house!

245
00:23:41,275 --> 00:23:43,266
<i>Who's there?</i>

246
00:23:45,245 --> 00:23:46,735
<i>Come in.</i>

247
00:23:51,985 --> 00:23:54,954
<i>Father!
What is it this early?</i>

248
00:24:01,495 --> 00:24:06,228
What is it, Father?
Did you lose your case?

249
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:09,832
Fool.
Don't worry about trifles.

250
00:24:28,752 --> 00:24:31,482
There's this month's allowance.

251
00:24:37,561 --> 00:24:41,224
If they declare you incompetent,

252
00:24:41,432 --> 00:24:43,730
I'll be cut out.

253
00:24:43,933 --> 00:24:46,197
Their petition be damned!

254
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:52,503
Listen, I wish
you could have seen it.

255
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,070
I mean,

256
00:24:55,545 --> 00:25:01,643
last night we watched movies
of the farm I plan to buy.

257
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,318
What a wonderful place!

258
00:25:05,387 --> 00:25:08,618
To be honest,
I was relieved.

259
00:25:11,226 --> 00:25:14,195
Anybody who saw it
would be reassured.

260
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:19,797
Since then,
they haven't said a word.

261
00:25:25,139 --> 00:25:27,471
It's all settled.

262
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:30,200
So don't fret.

263
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:34,177
Bring your mother's ashes
and come with us to Brazil.

264
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:46,418
Father...

265
00:25:47,627 --> 00:25:49,754
don't worry about me.

266
00:25:50,496 --> 00:25:53,124
I'm not part of your family.

267
00:25:53,632 --> 00:25:58,399
I don't want to go all that way
just to be a burden.

268
00:25:59,737 --> 00:26:03,764
If you could just give me
enough to get by on...

269
00:26:05,043 --> 00:26:08,774
I don't mind staying behind.
I'll be fine.

270
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,939
What are you blabbering about?
First of all -

271
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:14,618
But -

272
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:16,984
Forget it.

273
00:26:18,288 --> 00:26:20,085
Leave it all to me.

274
00:26:20,291 --> 00:26:21,656
Father!

275
00:26:25,563 --> 00:26:27,656
SÃ£o Paulo?

276
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,998
Taeko, you studied it
in geography class, right?

277
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:38,004
It's not far from a town
called SÃ£o Paolo.

278
00:26:38,242 --> 00:26:41,609
It was a real relief
seeing that moving picture.

279
00:26:41,811 --> 00:26:44,177
As far as the eye can see -

280
00:26:44,714 --> 00:26:50,152
We appreciate your kind offer
to take us along, but -

281
00:26:50,386 --> 00:26:51,512
Right?

282
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:54,781
Right. We couldn't
dare ask that of you.

283
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,687
Fools!
Why are you all so -

284
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:03,853
Never mind.
Just leave things to me.

285
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:19,274
We need to increase our stock this month.
We'll need a little extra.

286
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:25,043
Nonsense! Why stock up
when we're moving to Brazil? Fool!

287
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:28,618
- Please -
- All right, all right!

288
00:27:29,889 --> 00:27:33,848
There's no way I'm going.
Who wants to move to Brazil?

289
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:46,233
SÃ£o Paolo!
He's gotta be crazy!

290
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:50,040
I just don't understand.

291
00:27:54,012 --> 00:27:57,971
Why are you all so concerned
about being a burden?

292
00:28:05,056 --> 00:28:08,685
Your father says
it would be selfish of him

293
00:28:08,893 --> 00:28:11,953
and put him more in my debt.

294
00:28:12,163 --> 00:28:14,654
You should both
just come along.

295
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:18,925
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll take care of it.

296
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:23,539
What's so funny?

297
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:27,436
You think he's worried
about being selfish?

298
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:30,238
He just doesn't want to go.

299
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:42,652
Don't you want to go?

300
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:45,758
Well, I -

301
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:48,862
You don't want to go?

302
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:40,375
Hello?

303
00:29:49,486 --> 00:29:55,425
Didn't you say
we meet next on the 23rd?

304
00:29:55,626 --> 00:29:58,288
It's been moved up?

305
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:03,857
You see,
the gentleman in the case

306
00:30:04,066 --> 00:30:06,830
has ignored our advice.

307
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:11,303
He's moving ahead
with his plan.

308
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:15,808
They say they can't
let him go on like this.

309
00:30:18,147 --> 00:30:19,978
Yes, that's right.

310
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:24,619
Yes, Mr. Hori has agreed
to the new date, so -

311
00:30:30,725 --> 00:30:34,286
Thank you so much.

312
00:31:27,346 --> 00:31:29,678
Mr. Nakajima, express mail.

313
00:31:39,357 --> 00:31:41,791
MRS. TO YO NAKAJIMA
MR. KIICHI NAKAJIMA

314
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:44,587
TOKYO FAMILY COURT

315
00:32:00,176 --> 00:32:05,341
Special bulletin:
Thunderstorm moving this way.

316
00:32:10,286 --> 00:32:12,049
Welcome home.

317
00:32:47,053 --> 00:32:52,685
My father's plans are neither
concrete nor well thought out.

318
00:32:52,892 --> 00:32:56,384
He intends to buy land
and a house in Brazil,

319
00:32:56,596 --> 00:33:00,692
but where he'll find US dollars
I don't know.

320
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:06,861
Emigration is allowed if there's
a clear and constructive reason,

321
00:33:07,073 --> 00:33:10,941
but he's running away
out of fear.

322
00:33:11,142 --> 00:33:15,374
He can't buy more dollars
than allowed by law.

323
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,243
I verified that
with the Ministry of Finance.

324
00:33:19,451 --> 00:33:22,682
This plan to go to Brazil

325
00:33:22,886 --> 00:33:27,084
will be a waste of money,
just like his underground bunker.

326
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:28,918
Fool!

327
00:33:32,997 --> 00:33:38,094
I don't need dollars
to buy that farm.

328
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:40,665
How so?

329
00:33:42,071 --> 00:33:47,737
It's easy if the owner
wants to return to Japan.

330
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:51,107
I could barter
my property for his.

331
00:33:56,385 --> 00:33:59,980
But that would be
circumventing the law -

332
00:34:00,188 --> 00:34:01,314
No.

333
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:06,426
I see nothing illegal about it.

334
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:13,694
Actually, I'd say
it's a very clever approach.

335
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:18,995
- And you've found this farm owner?
- I have.

336
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:43,553
After you.

337
00:34:45,998 --> 00:34:47,625
What about this?

338
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:52,627
Your father is
very concerned about you.

339
00:34:52,837 --> 00:34:56,603
Couldn't you go along
with him on this?

340
00:34:56,808 --> 00:35:01,142
As I've listened
to the various points,

341
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:05,406
I've begun to feel
that it isn't such a bad idea.

342
00:35:05,616 --> 00:35:09,484
A lot of people
want to go to Brazil now,

343
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:11,951
more than the ships can carry.

344
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:14,317
I beg to disagree.

345
00:35:14,525 --> 00:35:20,589
You fail to take into account
the circumstances of our lives.

346
00:35:20,831 --> 00:35:25,461
Put yourself in our shoes.
We're doing fine as it is.

347
00:35:25,669 --> 00:35:27,569
Why should we have to -

348
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:29,432
Right, Ichiro?

349
00:35:30,807 --> 00:35:36,905
We were all born
and raised in that foundry.

350
00:35:37,114 --> 00:35:41,983
Exactly. We can't imagine
living outside of it.

351
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:44,048
How dare you!

352
00:35:44,253 --> 00:35:49,054
I'm the one who poured
his entire life into that foundry!

353
00:35:50,092 --> 00:35:54,756
I'll miss it more than anybody!

354
00:36:04,738 --> 00:36:07,707
I understand.

355
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:13,104
I realize what you're willing to endure
moving to Brazil for our sake,

356
00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:15,337
and I'm grateful.

357
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:20,145
But it's an unwelcome kindness
all the same.

358
00:36:20,353 --> 00:36:24,551
My husband teaches French.
What would he do in Brazil?

359
00:36:26,592 --> 00:36:28,560
And how do I
become a farmer?

360
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:30,422
Fool!

361
00:36:30,763 --> 00:36:34,290
Don't you realize that life
is the most precious thing?

362
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,469
Of course life is precious,

363
00:36:37,669 --> 00:36:40,229
but everybody has to die
sooner or later.

364
00:36:40,472 --> 00:36:42,497
What difference
does it make how?

365
00:36:42,707 --> 00:36:45,608
Yes, try to see it that way.

366
00:36:46,912 --> 00:36:50,177
Everybody has to die,
but I won't be murdered!

367
00:37:18,374 --> 00:37:24,472
Let me ask you, Father:
Are we the only ones going to Brazil?

368
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:26,114
Jiro!

369
00:37:26,315 --> 00:37:29,148
We can't have secrets
at a time like this!

370
00:37:29,351 --> 00:37:30,545
Doctor...

371
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,150
you remember the people
I was arguing with last time?

372
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:39,293
They're -

373
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,561
I don't want to disgrace the family,
but they're my father's -

374
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:50,669
You see, I have five others
besides these here to support:

375
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:54,972
Two mistresses,
their two children,

376
00:37:55,176 --> 00:37:58,839
and a son
by a mistress now dead.

377
00:37:59,045 --> 00:38:01,707
And I intend
to take them all with me!

378
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:07,150
You see?
It's utter insanity!

379
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,887
Maybe we could bear it,
but my mother -

380
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:12,455
Jiro, I'll be -

381
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:18,392
Mother, speak up!
You can't go on suffering in silence!

382
00:38:19,031 --> 00:38:22,865
Now you see
how absurdly selfish he is.

383
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:26,663
Self-centered and selfish!

384
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:30,433
We've been victims
of his selfishness for too long.

385
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:35,308
Father, if you must go to Brazil,
go by yourself.

386
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:38,607
Hell, take your mistresses
and bastard kids too.

387
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,841
Just count us out.

388
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,513
You ungrateful bastard!

389
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:02,037
Miss Sué, over here!

390
00:39:07,376 --> 00:39:09,105
Is the owner in?

391
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,940
Father? He's in court.

392
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:14,013
I thought
the case was dropped.

393
00:39:14,215 --> 00:39:17,013
They're deciding today.

394
00:39:27,195 --> 00:39:29,254
Where did Father go?

395
00:39:33,367 --> 00:39:35,597
He didn't go home, did he?

396
00:39:35,804 --> 00:39:37,203
Don't be silly.

397
00:39:37,404 --> 00:39:39,929
Let him go home
if he wants.

398
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,769
If he does, we win.
First of all -

399
00:41:08,289 --> 00:41:10,450
It seems to me

400
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:15,062
we have no choice
but to grant their petition.

401
00:41:17,732 --> 00:41:19,324
Dr. Harada?

402
00:41:23,538 --> 00:41:25,563
That's it then.

403
00:41:27,908 --> 00:41:30,035
Just a moment, please.

404
00:41:32,145 --> 00:41:35,740
When we declare people
incompetent

405
00:41:35,949 --> 00:41:38,440
due to fiscal irresponsibility,

406
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:44,214
it's usually for wasting money
on women, alcohol, and gambling.

407
00:41:44,457 --> 00:41:47,051
But taking precautions
against A-bombs -

408
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,229
In general, that's true.

409
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:56,129
But his behavior goes
far beyond common sense.

410
00:41:56,335 --> 00:42:00,169
That's right. His psychiatric tests
showed no abnormalities,

411
00:42:00,372 --> 00:42:02,431
but he's gone too far.

412
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,303
That's my point:
His only fault is going too far.

413
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:13,178
But his anxiety about the bomb
is something we all share.

414
00:42:13,384 --> 00:42:18,014
Mr. Araki, Mr. Hori, Miss Tamiya -
you all know that feeling.

415
00:42:18,923 --> 00:42:20,891
Isn't that true?

416
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:25,459
We just don't feel it
quite as strongly.

417
00:42:25,662 --> 00:42:32,226
We don't build underground shelters
or plan to move to Brazil.

418
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:39,901
But can we claim that the feeling
is beyond comprehension?

419
00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:47,140
The Japanese all share it,
to greater or lesser degrees.

420
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:54,221
We can't dispense with it so easily
by just saying he went too far -

421
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:58,222
I'm approaching this
as a practical problem.

422
00:42:59,027 --> 00:43:01,791
The old man feels as he does,

423
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:08,197
but his family doesn't feel
like going to Brazil with him.

424
00:43:08,403 --> 00:43:13,340
Forcing them to go
would violate their rights.

425
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:17,442
Suppose we leave
the situation as it is.

426
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:22,912
He's sure to sell
his house and foundry.

427
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:28,782
His family will lose its livelihood
and be left on the street.

428
00:43:28,988 --> 00:43:33,550
Yes, that's what the investigator's
report concluded.

429
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,920
That's right.

430
00:43:35,128 --> 00:43:40,657
To prevent that, we have
to declare him incompetent.

431
00:43:40,866 --> 00:43:43,699
I understand that.
Nonetheless...

432
00:43:43,902 --> 00:43:47,497
why have we deliberated
at such length

433
00:43:47,706 --> 00:43:50,675
if it's that simple?

434
00:43:54,912 --> 00:44:01,818
In any event, we can't
look at him and remain unmoved.

435
00:44:03,486 --> 00:44:08,150
That's because
his fear of the bomb

436
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:11,020
is palpable and real

437
00:44:11,229 --> 00:44:16,189
in a way that neither we
nor his family can grasp.

438
00:44:16,399 --> 00:44:22,565
But why does he feel it so strongly?
What triggered it?

439
00:44:22,938 --> 00:44:26,135
We should try hard
to figure that out.

440
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,738
Anxiety?

441
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:37,079
No, I feel nothing of the sort.

442
00:44:42,992 --> 00:44:46,257
Then why the hurry
to go to Brazil?

443
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:52,397
I believe the bomb
can be avoided.

444
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,366
Why let them kill you
if you have a choice?

445
00:44:56,571 --> 00:44:58,835
That's why I'm in a hurry.

446
00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:03,634
It's the cowards who tremble
and close their eyes to reality.

447
00:45:03,844 --> 00:45:06,244
My children
are a good example.

448
00:45:18,557 --> 00:45:20,855
Cowards, eh?

449
00:45:25,163 --> 00:45:30,499
Alas, I'm afraid
that includes us.

450
00:45:39,844 --> 00:45:42,244
So what do we do now?

451
00:45:42,446 --> 00:45:44,778
What choice do we have?

452
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:48,976
Dr. Harada,
look at it from this angle:

453
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:53,889
It's obvious
the man's being rash.

454
00:45:54,091 --> 00:45:59,028
He's grappling with a problem
too big for any one individual.

455
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:04,996
If he keeps on like this,
he'll get himself into real trouble.

456
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:10,798
Isn't restraining him
before it's too late

457
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:16,869
really the kindest thing
we can do?

458
00:46:24,252 --> 00:46:26,379
Miss Tamiya.

459
00:46:31,927 --> 00:46:34,259
Will you all come in, please?

460
00:47:03,889 --> 00:47:06,517
Father, it's 11:00.

461
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:14,922
What are you reading?

462
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:25,598
THE ASHES OF DEATH

463
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:30,345
Are you all right? Don't tell me
you want to go to Brazil too.

464
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:32,482
Read it yourself.

465
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:38,087
If the birds and beasts could read it,
they'd all flee Japan.

466
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,377
Susumu.

467
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:15,951
This whole thing leaves
a bad taste in my mouth.

468
00:48:16,658 --> 00:48:18,888
You mean the case?

469
00:48:19,427 --> 00:48:24,763
Don't let it get to you.
The old man won't give up that easily.

470
00:48:25,165 --> 00:48:31,570
He appealed right away, of course.
Now it goes to a higher court.

471
00:48:31,772 --> 00:48:33,239
Good.

472
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,204
It's no longer
your responsibility.

473
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,246
This is wonderful!

474
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:30,154
For 30 years
I've seen this view in my dreams.

475
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:32,692
It looks closer in winter.

476
00:49:32,896 --> 00:49:35,694
I'd like to breed cattle here.

477
00:49:35,899 --> 00:49:40,393
I'm a farmer. I wouldn't know
what to do with your foundry.

478
00:49:40,737 --> 00:49:45,504
Would you buy this land
for me instead?

479
00:49:47,276 --> 00:49:49,210
How big is it?

480
00:49:49,411 --> 00:49:54,212
I'd guess about 60 acres.

481
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:58,680
<i>The area is about 20 chobu.</i>

482
00:49:59,254 --> 00:50:00,881
What's the price?

483
00:50:02,691 --> 00:50:06,422
8.2 million yen.

484
00:50:06,627 --> 00:50:09,061
Isn't that kind of expensive?

485
00:50:09,297 --> 00:50:14,098
In Brazil we could buy
24,000 acres for that amount.

486
00:50:15,102 --> 00:50:17,263
What about a deposit?

487
00:50:17,672 --> 00:50:20,732
I'd need one soon.

488
00:50:20,942 --> 00:50:23,843
I've got
another interested buyer.

489
00:50:24,044 --> 00:50:26,569
I'm asking how much!

490
00:50:28,782 --> 00:50:31,410
1.5 million.

491
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:49,930
Jiro, are you sure
this is proper?

492
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:53,831
We have no choice.
We don't know what Father's up to.

493
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:58,669
Or what you'll be up to either,
once you get that combination.

494
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,650
Ichiro, any news?

495
00:51:21,164 --> 00:51:23,792
- Well?
- It's serious!

496
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:25,798
Water!

497
00:51:31,407 --> 00:51:32,965
Well?

498
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:37,836
Our vendors didn't know that
Father was declared incompetent.

499
00:51:38,047 --> 00:51:41,983
They paid company bills
directly to him!

500
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:44,583
How much altogether?

501
00:51:44,853 --> 00:51:46,980
I wonder what he's planning.

502
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,019
How much?

503
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:57,958
Kitakawa, 280,000.
Nakatsuka, 430,000.

504
00:51:58,165 --> 00:52:02,158
Takano, 160,000. Omori, 150,000.
Hamaguchi, 200,000.

505
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,461
Is that it?

506
00:52:03,671 --> 00:52:05,639
1,220,000 yen.

507
00:52:06,939 --> 00:52:09,169
That much?

508
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:13,210
That's Dad for you.
Only took him two days.

509
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,251
Stop it, you stupid jerk!

510
00:52:41,573 --> 00:52:45,873
Let me have that term deposit
certificate I gave your mother.

511
00:52:46,111 --> 00:52:47,635
What for?

512
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:51,975
I need money in a hurry.
Lend it to me.

513
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:57,379
Don't worry.
I'm about to -

514
00:52:57,588 --> 00:52:59,215
I know.

515
00:52:59,623 --> 00:53:03,923
But no matter
how many times you appeal,

516
00:53:04,662 --> 00:53:07,256
I don't think you'll win.

517
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:09,932
Fool! I'll win!

518
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:11,964
I wonder.

519
00:53:17,107 --> 00:53:20,235
You little bastard!
After everything I've done!

520
00:53:20,442 --> 00:53:25,072
That money's
the only thing I can count on.

521
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:38,559
The deed to the shop?

522
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,389
I need it as collateral
for a loan.

523
00:53:45,032 --> 00:53:48,263
I'll give it back in no time.

524
00:53:50,771 --> 00:53:52,705
No, I won't do it!

525
00:53:54,675 --> 00:53:59,044
Besides, when are you going
to put Taeko in your family register?

526
00:53:59,612 --> 00:54:03,173
First you leave her out,
and now you take the shop!

527
00:54:03,383 --> 00:54:05,749
Of course
I'll acknowledge her.

528
00:54:07,387 --> 00:54:08,854
Well...

529
00:54:09,054 --> 00:54:14,253
we'll talk about the deed
after you do that.

530
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,401
What? You spent it?

531
00:54:25,671 --> 00:54:27,161
I'm sorry.

532
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:29,397
What were you thinking?
Fool!

533
00:54:29,607 --> 00:54:31,541
What's wrong?

534
00:54:31,743 --> 00:54:36,407
I sent him to cash
a promissory note for 200,000 yen.

535
00:54:36,613 --> 00:54:40,071
That's like trusting
a cat with milk.

536
00:54:40,284 --> 00:54:42,775
I was in a hurry.

537
00:54:44,222 --> 00:54:46,281
Cough it up.

538
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:47,821
What?

539
00:54:48,025 --> 00:54:49,959
Don't act dumb!
The money!

540
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:53,686
- I spent it.
- You couldn't have spent it all.

541
00:54:53,896 --> 00:54:58,629
In half a day?
You wouldn't dare.

542
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:01,804
- There's nothing left!
- Liar!

543
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:27,358
Is this really all?
You gave some to that woman!

544
00:55:27,561 --> 00:55:29,256
What are you talking about?

545
00:55:29,464 --> 00:55:32,831
I'll find out soon enough.

546
00:55:57,189 --> 00:56:01,091
It was hard keeping this
hidden from you, Father.

547
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:04,761
I saved it from my allowance.

548
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,126
It's not enough
to cover the loss, but -

549
00:56:09,001 --> 00:56:12,232
Even the 200,000
wasn't enough. Forget it.

550
00:56:12,804 --> 00:56:16,171
What's the matter?
This isn't like you.

551
00:56:16,841 --> 00:56:20,572
There's no point in going in
without enough!

552
00:56:20,778 --> 00:56:27,013
Why don't you explain what happened
and just apologize like a man?

553
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:29,386
That's what I'd do.

554
00:57:09,824 --> 00:57:15,126
You really are
a good and honest man.

555
00:57:15,496 --> 00:57:18,124
I admire you very much.

556
00:57:18,732 --> 00:57:21,326
Very well. I'll wait.

557
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,667
But...

558
00:57:23,870 --> 00:57:26,600
I can't stay in Tokyo forever.

559
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:31,407
I'd planned to leave
in a few days.

560
00:57:31,610 --> 00:57:36,343
Don't worry.
This is a gentlemen's agreement.

561
00:57:37,483 --> 00:57:43,945
When your affairs are settled,
come visit the farm.

562
00:57:44,924 --> 00:57:49,054
Meanwhile,
take your money back.

563
00:57:50,595 --> 00:57:56,727
You know, when my father
wanted to emigrate to Brazil,

564
00:57:56,935 --> 00:58:00,200
I fought him tooth and nail.

565
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:06,804
Then our house
burned down in a fire.

566
00:58:07,045 --> 00:58:11,038
That forced me
to change my mind.

567
00:58:12,483 --> 00:58:15,008
That's how people are.

568
00:58:15,252 --> 00:58:19,018
I understand
your sons' concern.

569
00:58:19,623 --> 00:58:25,152
Return this money
to them for now.

570
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:28,988
Discuss it with them amicably.

571
00:58:29,198 --> 00:58:32,565
They're your children,
after all.

572
00:58:56,024 --> 00:58:57,651
It's all there.

573
00:59:00,728 --> 00:59:02,662
Wait a minute, Ichiro.

574
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:06,731
Let's let Father
spend it as he likes.

575
00:59:07,735 --> 00:59:11,728
That will settle
the case once and for all.

576
00:59:14,341 --> 00:59:18,607
Don't you see?
He'll prove that he's incompetent.

577
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:21,377
What the -
Fool!

578
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:23,481
What's the point
of getting angry?

579
00:59:23,683 --> 00:59:27,414
It's not our fault.
You created this situation.

580
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:31,647
I obtained a court injunction
against disposal of our assets

581
00:59:31,857 --> 00:59:34,951
while we await your appeal.

582
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:41,030
Nobody can spend a yen
without the court's permission.

583
00:59:41,233 --> 00:59:45,533
What you've been doing
is clearly illegal.

584
00:59:45,737 --> 00:59:48,900
You've already ensured
that your appeal will be rejected.

585
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:52,076
But Father brought back
the money.

586
00:59:52,276 --> 00:59:54,210
We won't accept it.

587
00:59:57,314 --> 00:59:59,009
Jiro, apologize!

588
01:00:16,433 --> 01:00:19,493
Those things
sure make travel easier!

589
01:00:19,702 --> 01:00:24,162
In four days
he'll be back in Brazil.

590
01:00:25,207 --> 01:00:28,142
Quite a man, isn't he?

591
01:00:29,044 --> 01:00:32,912
You can rest easy too.

592
01:01:44,449 --> 01:01:46,280
Excuse me.

593
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:50,578
Aren't you Mr. Nakajima?

594
01:01:51,889 --> 01:01:55,882
Remember me?
I'm Dr. Harada.

595
01:01:56,961 --> 01:02:00,089
Harada, from family court.

596
01:02:47,041 --> 01:02:49,236
Mr. Nakajima!

597
01:02:54,047 --> 01:02:56,174
What do you want?

598
01:02:56,383 --> 01:03:00,717
Well, nothing
in particular, but -

599
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,888
Then you'll excuse me.

600
01:03:21,572 --> 01:03:24,473
I must tell you one thing,

601
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:28,476
you and the others
who ruled against me.

602
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:34,345
I told you then
I wasn't afraid of the bomb.

603
01:03:34,584 --> 01:03:38,281
But just look at me now!
Can't you see?

604
01:03:38,855 --> 01:03:42,256
I'm out of my mind with fear!

605
01:03:44,461 --> 01:03:47,953
And it's you
who made me like this!

606
01:03:48,931 --> 01:03:53,027
Thanks to you,
there's nothing I can do.

607
01:03:53,235 --> 01:03:54,930
Nothing!

608
01:03:55,137 --> 01:03:58,834
I keep thinking
about the H-bomb,

609
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:01,475
but all I can do is think!

610
01:04:01,676 --> 01:04:06,909
And the more I think,
the more restless I become.

611
01:04:07,115 --> 01:04:09,743
But there's nothing I can do!

612
01:04:09,951 --> 01:04:12,613
It's a living hell!

613
01:04:39,579 --> 01:04:41,547
But really...

614
01:04:42,682 --> 01:04:46,641
is there anything else
we could have done?

615
01:04:46,853 --> 01:04:52,849
That case has been
very much on my mind too.

616
01:04:53,059 --> 01:04:59,294
But no matter how you look at it,
there was no other possible solution.

617
01:04:59,965 --> 01:05:05,096
Even forgetting
my role as judge

618
01:05:05,303 --> 01:05:08,932
and approaching
the problem as his ally,

619
01:05:09,974 --> 01:05:13,910
there'd be no way
to save him from his misery.

620
01:05:15,246 --> 01:05:19,683
That misery
is nobody's fault, really.

621
01:05:19,884 --> 01:05:24,014
It simply stems from the fact
that the H-bomb exists,

622
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:29,420
and from his rather
unusual disposition.

623
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:35,695
His mind has no sense
of proper limits.

624
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:42,066
He thinks far too much -
about everything.

625
01:06:40,192 --> 01:06:41,784
Sir...

626
01:06:43,428 --> 01:06:46,989
this spooky weather
doesn't let up, does it?

627
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:54,571
The newspapers say
it's from an H-bomb test.

628
01:06:58,977 --> 01:07:03,038
You probably know
better than anyone,

629
01:07:03,247 --> 01:07:07,547
but they say that
even if a bomb is dropped

630
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:11,312
on China, or America,
or Russia,

631
01:07:11,555 --> 01:07:14,922
the fallout will eventually
drift over Japan.

632
01:07:20,997 --> 01:07:23,158
I don't really understand it.

633
01:07:23,366 --> 01:07:27,132
Something to do
with atmospheric currents.

634
01:07:27,903 --> 01:07:34,172
Japan's a sort of valley
that all radioactivity flows into.

635
01:07:34,809 --> 01:07:38,905
But what about those of us
living in that valley?

636
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,945
What will happen to us?

637
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:52,624
First our hair will fall out.

638
01:07:55,195 --> 01:07:58,096
In the end our bones
will crumble and rot.

639
01:07:59,066 --> 01:08:02,297
Not something
to look forward to, eh?

640
01:08:07,808 --> 01:08:14,873
The other day I saw a report
on the bomb damage in Hiroshima.

641
01:08:15,181 --> 01:08:18,514
It was really gruesome.

642
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:24,451
I'll bet you saw it too.

643
01:08:24,656 --> 01:08:27,147
- A baby his age -
- Stop it!

644
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,452
Terribly sorry, sir.

645
01:08:29,661 --> 01:08:36,123
I should've realized
it's already weighing on your mind.

646
01:08:36,968 --> 01:08:42,804
But even worry
has to be done in moderation.

647
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:48,340
You know, you can't
do anything without money.

648
01:08:49,212 --> 01:08:51,442
Please don't be too stubborn.

649
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:56,746
Make peace with your sons
and get as much as you can.

650
01:09:01,157 --> 01:09:04,524
You're in a good position.

651
01:09:04,728 --> 01:09:07,959
Even if you've been
declared incompetent,

652
01:09:08,163 --> 01:09:11,098
you could still
retire comfortably.

653
01:09:13,802 --> 01:09:19,536
Whereas we can't afford
to support you here -

654
01:09:29,551 --> 01:09:32,782
Is he asleep?
Thanks.

655
01:09:34,255 --> 01:09:35,950
What's wrong?

656
01:09:36,157 --> 01:09:38,057
This just won't do.

657
01:09:38,526 --> 01:09:41,495
You haven't slept for days.

658
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:55,998
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE H-BOMB -
A WEAPON TO DESTRO Y HUMANITY

659
01:09:56,876 --> 01:09:59,970
Madness,
inventing such a thing!

660
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:07,511
Where are you going?

661
01:10:09,121 --> 01:10:10,748
Home.

662
01:10:11,089 --> 01:10:14,650
All of you come with me!

663
01:10:15,827 --> 01:10:19,422
What?
How could I face them?

664
01:10:19,631 --> 01:10:21,599
Never mind that!
Just come!

665
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:45,587
Thank you.
Sorry for the bother.

666
01:11:28,562 --> 01:11:33,397
Father, why have you
gathered us all here?

667
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:55,614
I'm begging you,
on my life.

668
01:11:56,755 --> 01:12:00,384
Come to Brazil with me.
I beg of you.

669
01:12:01,794 --> 01:12:04,627
All of you, as one family.

670
01:12:06,698 --> 01:12:11,101
You say I'm paranoid,
and maybe I am.

671
01:12:12,037 --> 01:12:16,030
But H-bombs really exist.

672
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:19,073
War could break out
at any time.

673
01:12:19,277 --> 01:12:25,147
If it does,
it'll be too late to get away.

674
01:12:26,049 --> 01:12:31,077
We can still make it.
Let's flee while we can.

675
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:41,358
I can't let him die.

676
01:12:42,431 --> 01:12:47,061
I can't let an H-bomb kill him
before he's even had a chance to live!

677
01:12:50,506 --> 01:12:52,736
I don't care about myself,

678
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:58,244
and I thought
I'd have to give up on you.

679
01:12:58,446 --> 01:13:03,509
I thought at one point
if I could at least save this baby -

680
01:13:04,452 --> 01:13:09,856
But you're all
my flesh and blood!

681
01:13:10,758 --> 01:13:13,124
I can't leave you here!

682
01:13:13,827 --> 01:13:17,490
Please come with me,
I'm begging you.

683
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:27,764
Look, he wrote
to me from Brazil.

684
01:13:28,642 --> 01:13:31,236
Listen to how kind he is:

685
01:13:31,444 --> 01:13:34,607
"Come at once.
I'll get you permanent residence. "

686
01:13:34,814 --> 01:13:37,840
He's like a Buddha
come to save us from hell.

687
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:40,644
We can build
a good life there.

688
01:13:40,887 --> 01:13:45,756
Even a stranger
is this kind to us.

689
01:13:46,659 --> 01:13:48,388
I beg you:

690
01:13:48,593 --> 01:13:52,859
Come with me to Brazil.

691
01:13:54,566 --> 01:13:57,228
I'm begging you.

692
01:13:59,437 --> 01:14:02,964
Everybody, please,
let's go with him.

693
01:14:04,075 --> 01:14:06,339
Look how he's begging you.

694
01:14:07,711 --> 01:14:11,374
I'm begging you too.

695
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:15,350
Please go with him.

696
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:20,750
Has Father ever
been wrong about anything?

697
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:24,324
He's always tried
to plan ahead,

698
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:28,486
not for himself,
but for all of us.

699
01:14:29,532 --> 01:14:32,330
Let's go, Ichiro.

700
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:35,869
Jiro, let's go.

701
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:39,598
Let's go, Yoshiko.

702
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:47,347
Why don't you say anything?

703
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:50,644
Why are you all so quiet?

704
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:05,392
Father, I'll go with you!

705
01:15:09,936 --> 01:15:12,097
Father!

706
01:15:18,844 --> 01:15:22,336
He's exhausted.
He needs rest.

707
01:15:22,548 --> 01:15:26,040
The injection
will help him fall asleep.

708
01:15:33,092 --> 01:15:36,255
I don't want
to stay here any longer.

709
01:15:37,061 --> 01:15:38,358
Well?

710
01:15:38,564 --> 01:15:42,261
There are more pressing matters
than getting in the family register.

711
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:48,804
What if he passes away?
We need to be put in his will.

712
01:15:49,007 --> 01:15:50,975
His will?

713
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:30,136
Didn't you get a dowry
when you married?

714
01:16:30,345 --> 01:16:34,509
Almost nothing. He needed
capital then for the foundry.

715
01:16:34,716 --> 01:16:39,346
Anyway, property can't be transferred
unless stated in his will.

716
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:42,021
You talk
like a lawyer nowadays.

717
01:16:49,163 --> 01:16:51,324
His will?

718
01:16:51,632 --> 01:16:54,123
What's that? His will?

719
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,461
They want to be included in it.

720
01:16:57,870 --> 01:17:01,636
That's horrible!
It's like they want him to die.

721
01:17:05,978 --> 01:17:07,843
Just a minute.

722
01:17:11,183 --> 01:17:15,984
Maybe that's best.
It would make things clear.

723
01:17:16,188 --> 01:17:19,988
Then Jiro couldn't talk to you
like he just did.

724
01:17:42,445 --> 01:17:44,208
He's sleepy, right?

725
01:17:44,982 --> 01:17:47,075
He can sleep in my room.

726
01:17:47,283 --> 01:17:50,548
This way.
Come on, it's okay.

727
01:17:50,754 --> 01:17:52,915
This way.

728
01:17:57,026 --> 01:18:02,464
- Father's asleep, so you can go home.
- Yes, but -

729
01:18:03,233 --> 01:18:09,934
In court you said we'd have
a chance to discuss these things.

730
01:18:10,139 --> 01:18:14,200
Perhaps I did,
but now's not the time.

731
01:18:14,408 --> 01:18:18,469
We hate to ask
at a time like this,

732
01:18:18,679 --> 01:18:23,616
but now's precisely
when we need to discuss it.

733
01:18:23,818 --> 01:18:25,080
He's right.

734
01:18:25,286 --> 01:18:28,346
I could talk to Father
about it for you.

735
01:18:28,556 --> 01:18:31,650
Father's fast asleep.

736
01:18:33,093 --> 01:18:37,826
The doctor said
it's the best thing for him.

737
01:18:46,873 --> 01:18:52,209
Pestering a sick man
about his will is going too far.

738
01:19:10,562 --> 01:19:12,723
Please forgive me.

739
01:19:12,964 --> 01:19:17,025
It's really
not my place to be here.

740
01:19:18,836 --> 01:19:21,737
Mother, look at the baby.

741
01:19:21,939 --> 01:19:24,100
He looks just like Father!

742
01:19:27,878 --> 01:19:30,608
It's no big deal.
Right, Mother?

743
01:19:30,814 --> 01:19:33,408
What are you saying?

744
01:19:34,751 --> 01:19:39,188
She doesn't hold it
against you.

745
01:19:39,423 --> 01:19:43,382
She just doesn't want to set
a bad example for her children.

746
01:19:43,594 --> 01:19:46,028
You silly girl!

747
01:20:00,976 --> 01:20:02,944
Care to take a look?

748
01:20:14,556 --> 01:20:17,150
Are these all your relatives?

749
01:20:22,630 --> 01:20:25,622
Even Father
doesn't get around that much!

750
01:20:25,832 --> 01:20:29,131
That's last year's
factory outing at the beach.

751
01:20:29,335 --> 01:20:32,566
We had such
a lovely time that day.

752
01:20:33,173 --> 01:20:36,404
It was really wonderful.

753
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:38,944
But you know...

754
01:20:39,145 --> 01:20:41,545
it was so much fun

755
01:20:41,781 --> 01:20:48,345
that I knew some misfortune
would come along.

756
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:51,181
I was so afraid,

757
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:54,359
and I was right.

758
01:22:40,025 --> 01:22:44,155
<i>- I guess we're going to Brazil!
- Well, I'm not!</i>

759
01:22:44,363 --> 01:22:47,890
<i>It seems
Mother and Sue are going.</i>

760
01:22:48,333 --> 01:22:50,460
- With what money?
- What money?

761
01:22:50,668 --> 01:22:54,536
If Mother withdraws her petition,
the court will release the money.

762
01:22:56,340 --> 01:22:59,207
Then what will happen to us?

763
01:23:00,544 --> 01:23:03,377
We'll probably get some too.

764
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:08,540
But not much,
staying against Father's wishes.

765
01:23:08,751 --> 01:23:11,743
What about the foundry?

766
01:23:11,954 --> 01:23:15,788
That's why we have
to fight selling it.

767
01:23:15,993 --> 01:23:19,520
We have to hold on to that
if nothing else.

768
01:23:19,729 --> 01:23:24,098
The foundry's the important thing.
As long as we have that...

769
01:23:44,084 --> 01:23:48,043
- Where's the Nakajima foundry?
- Around that corner.

770
01:23:48,255 --> 01:23:52,385
- There was a terrible accident.
- A real tragedy.

771
01:25:00,856 --> 01:25:03,051
I demand an explanation!

772
01:25:09,498 --> 01:25:12,023
Explain yourself,
you son of a bitch!

773
01:25:14,702 --> 01:25:16,897
Can you think
of any other cause?

774
01:25:17,106 --> 01:25:21,202
You said you forgot
to quench the coals!

775
01:25:22,077 --> 01:25:27,014
Foreman, don't you remember
how strict Father was about that?

776
01:25:27,215 --> 01:25:29,706
"Always check the work area. "

777
01:25:30,218 --> 01:25:32,379
Look at Father!

778
01:25:39,026 --> 01:25:42,655
Boss, please forgive me!

779
01:26:01,647 --> 01:26:04,775
No, it was me.

780
01:26:05,484 --> 01:26:08,612
I set this fire.

781
01:26:09,254 --> 01:26:14,783
Don't try to protect them.
The police will be here to investigate.

782
01:26:14,993 --> 01:26:18,053
I tell you,
I started the fire!

783
01:26:18,263 --> 01:26:20,857
You're talking nonsense
from the shock.

784
01:26:21,066 --> 01:26:22,658
Mother!

785
01:26:23,868 --> 01:26:25,768
Take Father inside!

786
01:26:26,670 --> 01:26:32,472
Jiro, because of this foundry,
you all refused to leave Japan

787
01:26:32,676 --> 01:26:34,871
and go to Brazil with me.

788
01:26:35,079 --> 01:26:38,845
I thought with the foundry
out of the way -

789
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:44,744
Sue.

790
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:54,521
Sue, did you see
what happened?

791
01:26:55,898 --> 01:26:58,128
Sue, answer me!

792
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,564
Why don't you say anything?

793
01:27:04,072 --> 01:27:06,632
Sue, tell me what happened!

794
01:27:06,874 --> 01:27:10,275
Sue, what happened?

795
01:27:12,780 --> 01:27:15,613
You were the first
to discover the fire.

796
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:18,912
What did you see
from this window?

797
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:24,858
Tell them who came
out of the foundry as the fire started!

798
01:27:29,729 --> 01:27:31,424
Don't cry.

799
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,668
We'll be all right.

800
01:27:37,270 --> 01:27:39,864
We may have lost the foundry,

801
01:27:40,073 --> 01:27:43,702
but we have enough
to live on in Brazil.

802
01:27:46,312 --> 01:27:49,008
Boss, you mean...

803
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:55,013
you don't care what happens
to the rest of us?

804
01:27:57,121 --> 01:27:59,089
Is that it, boss?

805
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:04,052
You don't care
if the rest of us starve?

806
01:28:06,898 --> 01:28:09,128
You've completely
lost your senses!

807
01:28:13,838 --> 01:28:17,569
You don't care
what happens to us?

808
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:38,822
I was wrong. Forgive me.

809
01:28:39,662 --> 01:28:42,859
I'll find a way to take you all.

810
01:28:51,339 --> 01:28:55,776
I was wrong to think
only of my family.

811
01:28:57,045 --> 01:29:00,537
You're right.
We all have to survive.

812
01:29:00,749 --> 01:29:02,774
Every one of us.

813
01:29:03,218 --> 01:29:08,884
I beg you,
come with me to Brazil.

814
01:29:09,089 --> 01:29:10,579
With what money?

815
01:29:13,327 --> 01:29:18,355
I seriously doubt
these workers want to go to Brazil.

816
01:29:18,564 --> 01:29:21,089
You can be so selfish.

817
01:29:21,301 --> 01:29:24,099
And what about
that old man from Brazil?

818
01:29:24,303 --> 01:29:30,208
You call him a Buddha, then ask him
to die in your place! We're not going!

819
01:29:31,177 --> 01:29:32,769
I understand.

820
01:29:33,846 --> 01:29:37,714
I'll talk to him.
I'll find a different farm.

821
01:29:38,217 --> 01:29:42,449
We can survive if we work hard.
We can even go to the Amazon.

822
01:29:42,654 --> 01:29:45,316
It doesn't matter
where you go.

823
01:29:45,524 --> 01:29:49,119
No place on earth
is safe from the H-bomb.

824
01:29:49,327 --> 01:29:55,266
Just 400 tons can kill all life!
There's more than that now!

825
01:29:55,466 --> 01:29:58,026
Shut up, you pompous ass!

826
01:29:58,236 --> 01:30:00,704
Have you given it
even a moment's thought?

827
01:30:00,905 --> 01:30:07,310
Father's been racked with worry
for all of our sakes,

828
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:10,775
while you think
of nothing but yourselves!

829
01:31:01,229 --> 01:31:03,823
This guy set fire
to his own house.

830
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:07,795
For the insurance?
Same old story.

831
01:31:08,001 --> 01:31:10,367
But this one's a real oddball.

832
01:31:10,570 --> 01:31:12,595
Quiet down!

833
01:31:33,892 --> 01:31:35,883
H- bombs?

834
01:31:42,066 --> 01:31:45,433
You're a fool
to worry about that stuff.

835
01:31:45,637 --> 01:31:47,935
Leave that
to the prime minister.

836
01:31:48,138 --> 01:31:54,043
Pops, if you're so afraid,
why not move to another planet?

837
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,728
PSYCHIATRIC WARD NO. 3

838
01:32:42,323 --> 01:32:47,158
You know,
maybe he'll be happier this way.

839
01:33:35,238 --> 01:33:38,799
Dr. Harada, isn't it?
Thank you for everything.

840
01:33:39,243 --> 01:33:43,907
Don't mention it.
Please accept my sympathies.

841
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,748
Have you come to see him?

842
01:33:46,950 --> 01:33:49,316
I feel...

843
01:33:50,286 --> 01:33:52,948
guilty about what's happened.

844
01:33:54,156 --> 01:33:59,321
I wonder if the court
perhaps made the wrong decision.

845
01:33:59,728 --> 01:34:01,923
Come now.

846
01:34:03,132 --> 01:34:06,363
If anyone's to blame, it's us.

847
01:34:06,901 --> 01:34:11,497
We shouldn't have
taken him to court.

848
01:34:11,806 --> 01:34:14,673
We should have
brought him here.

849
01:34:15,411 --> 01:34:20,974
That would have been better
for all concerned, including Father.

850
01:34:22,483 --> 01:34:25,611
Anyway,
I'll let you go see him.

851
01:34:35,195 --> 01:34:37,220
Good-bye now.

852
01:35:11,029 --> 01:35:15,830
Whenever I see this patient,

853
01:35:16,968 --> 01:35:19,801
I become terribly depressed.

854
01:35:22,039 --> 01:35:24,667
This is the first time
that's happened to me.

855
01:35:25,676 --> 01:35:32,206
Of course the insane
are depressing to be around.

856
01:35:34,617 --> 01:35:36,141
That said...

857
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:40,887
whenever I see him...

858
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:46,451
I somehow feel...

859
01:35:48,364 --> 01:35:51,822
oddly anxious...

860
01:35:52,834 --> 01:35:56,099
even though I'm the one
who's supposed to be sane.

861
01:35:58,807 --> 01:36:02,538
Is he crazy?

862
01:36:05,579 --> 01:36:11,449
Or are we, who can remain
unperturbed in an insane world,

863
01:36:11,652 --> 01:36:13,711
the crazy ones?

864
01:36:23,696 --> 01:36:25,391
<i>This way, please.</i>

865
01:37:33,829 --> 01:37:35,694
It's Dr. Harada.

866
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:50,438
I'm glad you came.

867
01:37:53,948 --> 01:37:56,576
Yes, I'm very glad you came.

868
01:38:00,888 --> 01:38:03,823
You're safe here.

869
01:38:04,491 --> 01:38:06,686
Have no fear.

870
01:38:10,597 --> 01:38:14,556
By the way...

871
01:38:15,102 --> 01:38:18,094
what happened to the Earth?

872
01:38:19,406 --> 01:38:23,172
Are many people
still left behind there?

873
01:38:25,378 --> 01:38:28,245
Are there still
many people there?

874
01:38:32,518 --> 01:38:34,383
That's not good.

875
01:38:35,587 --> 01:38:37,919
Not good at all.

876
01:38:38,356 --> 01:38:42,452
They'd better escape soon
or they'll be sorry!

877
01:38:42,793 --> 01:38:46,194
Why don't they understand?

878
01:38:47,197 --> 01:38:51,827
They better hurry
and come to this planet!

879
01:38:52,303 --> 01:38:54,533
They better hurry -

880
01:38:57,207 --> 01:38:59,232
Is it burning?

881
01:39:03,547 --> 01:39:06,573
The Earth is burning!

882
01:39:09,585 --> 01:39:11,780
The Earth is burning!

883
01:39:16,192 --> 01:39:17,887
It's burning!

884
01:39:19,795 --> 01:39:21,387
It's burning!

885
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:30,129
It's burning!

886
01:39:34,776 --> 01:39:38,143
The Earth has finally
gone up in flames!

887
01:41:04,627 --> 01:41:07,391
THE END
